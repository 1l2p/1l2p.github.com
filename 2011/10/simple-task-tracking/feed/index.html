		<description><![CDATA[Hi have you tried www.taskbiller.com  once a client requests a task you insert it assign it to a sub contractor or yourself and attach it to a customer, put a planned time to it or an agreed price. Then if you need more information you use taskbiller to communicate with the customer. At the end of the month you run up the customers bill and all the line items are there and the prices agreed or timespent is listed, your sub contractor can bill you from the system too so no more excel shhets ans trying to reconcile bills at the end of the month. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Philipp,

One thing you can try with BubbleTimer is to use the notes feature to put in what meetings you went to. There is a sticky pad note at the end (right side) of every activity near the time total for that activity. Just click it and you have a free form spot for notes. Later, if you look at the print summary of how you spent your time each day, those notes are shown. So you&#039;ll be able to see where your meeting time went.

Cheers,
Sean]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Andrew - thanks for the link. I checked it out and really like it. Only caveat is that it feels wrong to record all my daily meetings (with different people) as one category. It&#039;s helpful to see that I spent (too) much time in meetings, but I would like to keep track of which meetings I went to. I&#039;ll try it out and see if it&#039;s a matter of rethinking how I track my activities - or if BubbleTimer isn&#039;t the right tool for me. But in terms of simple time tracking - it&#039;s the nicest one I&#039;ve seen so far.]]></description>

You didn&#039;t specify anything for the time tracking app, but I would recommend you check out an app that we at SnootyMonkey have put together: bubbletimer.com]]></description>
