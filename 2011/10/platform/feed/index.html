		<description><![CDATA[@Karen - you are absolutely right that being a platform is hard, hard work, and potentially expensive. 

What are some of the platforms in this space we should learn from? 

And yes - just platform isn&#039;t enough. We originally agreed on three core values for P2PU: open, community, peer learning. I think the platform idea is related to the original thoughts about open and peer-learning, but the community aspect is crucial and needs to be front and centre. 

And I&#039;m not sure that &quot;platform&quot; is really the right term. I think you and I have a similar understanding of what a platform is, but I find myself having to explain it to people outside of the tech-world. I&#039;ll do a follow up post about reframing it slightly. 

An open platform for peer-learning? Maybe. A community? Definitely!!! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re deciding to be a platform, you better be a really good one. There are a lot of platforms out there. Being a platform means a commitment to serious and ongoing development ($). And yes, I agree that it must be &quot;extendable, hackable, malleable&quot; and customizable. (API)

To be a top-rate peer learning environment in the way I think P2PU construes seems integrally tied to content and methodology and even worldview. In peer learning, all of this may be more important than &quot;platform.&quot; If you have a great platform but don&#039;t monitor content and it turns into a giant Pokemon site, you probably haven&#039;t won. So how do content, community, and methods tie into this? Perhaps this relates to the &quot;one great product&quot; you talk about? I&#039;m not sure, but it seems to me that P2PU needs to be more than a platform.

How does being a platform help with sustainability? Will you sell or license the platform to organizations? If that is the plan, see paragraph #1. For organizations I work with in education, I am highly recommending free, open platforms, because a) many are superior to propriety/fee-based platforms and b) most organizations I work with can&#039;t sustain paying for platforms. (Even if they could, they&#039;d be better off spending money on people and content.)

Just my thoughts. It will be interesting to see how this moves ahead. These are critically important issues.]]></description>
