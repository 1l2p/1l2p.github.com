		<description><![CDATA[Hey Heather: I think it&#039;s partly the self-selection bias of the sample. There was no way to do a randomized representative sample with an online community like this. So, lower percentages in the respondents, do not necessarily mean that this is the case for the universe of wikipedia contributors. On the other hand, the number of respondents is so large that we can infer certain trends at least. My impression at Wikimania last year (using a completely non-scientific approach of gut feeling) confirms this, there were more male participants than female ones. I&#039;ll start looking at gender differences for countries and age groups - and let you know if I find something interesting. Thanks for the comment!]]></description>
