		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say thanks for setting this course up. I&#039;m looking forward to participating over the next few weeks. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll learn a lot and it will help me focus my thoughts on open education.

Can I also add that I&#039;ve set up a community site for anyone interested in the JISC #jiscri funding call (http://learninglab.lincoln.ac.uk/jiscri/). It&#039;s to accompany the funding call document, which we re-published on http://writetoreply.org/jiscri where people can comment, ask questions and discuss the call. We&#039;re working these sites up into a bid of our own, but really hope they&#039;ll be of use to the JISC community.]]></description>
