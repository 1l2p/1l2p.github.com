		<description><![CDATA[When I initially read the title on teaching naked in the classroom (teaching without technology) I assumed that it meant using technology outside of the 4 walls we call the classroom. I suppose it speaks of the fact that I traditionally view teaching as something that only takes place in the classroom. Whereas we know that the classroom environment really only forms one aspect of teaching. Granted the time there could be used more effectively and I think it is that which Mr Bowen refers to. Students will often find PPt useful simply because they are not given alternatives like podcasts to listen to. It&#039;s usefulness has got a lot to do with the culture of the students at an institution and the way in which students make use of online material ie. what are their learning habits/styles, how do they interact with online material. For example, I didn&#039;t know that some students download PPt&#039;s to have them printed. For the students, the PPT serves as their notes. I agree that this culture exists basically because of the way in which lectures are conducted but like you&#039;ve indicated, technology sometimes get a bad rap for poor teaching techniques. What we need is good teaching facilitated by technology so that all that comes through is the good teaching. But as is often the case we shoot down the messenger (technology).]]></description>
