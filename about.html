<h1>J. Philipp Schmidt</h1>

<p>
I am curious about most things, and passionate about learning. I create new tools, platforms, and institutions that spur creative learning. My core design principle is generosity. 
</p>

<p>I am Director of Learning Innovation at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, where I lead the <a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu">Learning Learning initiative</a>, teach courses, and conduct research. 
I am also a cofounder and board member of <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)</a>, a non-profit organization and online community that experiments with new ways of learning. I served on the founding board of the <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a> and co-authored the <a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/">Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a>. I received <a href="https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org">Shuttleworth</a> and <a href="http://usa.ashoka.org/fellow/philipp-schmidt">Ashoka</a> and MIT Media Lab Director's fellowships. 

<p>
I live in Boston and miss <a href="http://ifspt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cape_town_2_mouille_point.jpg">Cape Town</a> and <a href="http://www.express.de/image/view/2012/10/11/20841120,16447272,highRes,1482D600701DECBD.jpg">Cologne</a>.
