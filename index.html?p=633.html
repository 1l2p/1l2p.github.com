          <h3 class="entry-title">Paying for infrastructure &#8211; Creative Commons Catalyst</h3>
          <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4>
          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Today Creative Commons launches their catalyst campaign &#8211; brother to the recently announced <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants" target="_blank">catalyst grant</a> programme. I like how they connect the two &#8211; funding their work AND raising money at the same time. On one hand, they offer small grants for projects that further their vision, and with the other hand they politely ask for donations to support it. It creates a connection between the donation and the purpose of that donation, even if it&#8217;s a very loose connection.</p>
<blockquote><p>Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organizations to harness the power of Creative Commons. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could support a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licenses to create a new class of socially responsible businesses. Anyone may apply for a Catalyst Grant, which ranges from $1,000-$10,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">But we can&#8217;t do it without your help.</a> Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the grants that will make all this possible. Donate today to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across all cultural and national boundaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>CC&#8217;s work is a very important foundation of a lot of the open content / commons movement &#8211; and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s easy to raise the funds necessary to support it. Hal Plotkin asked this question after his keynote at the recent OCWC Global conference. How should and can something that provides an important, but not very glamorous (my words, not Hal&#8217;s, with apologies to my lawyer friends at CC) enabling service be supported financially? Funding for infrastructure is difficult to raise. It&#8217;s a little bit like raising money for TCP/IP or HTTP. Everyone will agree that it&#8217;s important and we all benefit from having it &#8211; but we all hope that someone else will pick up the tab. We rely on that friend of a friend who got rich on stock options, sold his company, or house &#8211; or simply inherited a lot of money.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a social democracy that offers high-quality infrastructure and services to (almost) all of its citizens, my immediate response is that infrastructure should be paid for by the state from tax income. I personally would welcome a small part of my tax payments to be used to support important infrastructure projects that enable free flow of knowledge and information. Even more so, now that I live in a country where access to knowledge is scarce and expensive. I believe such would be an excellent investment in future development and well-being of all citizens.</p>
<p>The problem with writing blog posts about topics like this is &#8211; you end up getting stuck in a dilemma. I have now explained that I think CC&#8217;s work is important, that I suspect many people fail to support it, and that the government should consider doing so. However, pending major adjustments in the political landscape of South Africa, that doesn&#8217;t really help anyone. So I went ahead and donated a little money to CC today.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/support/2010/cc-support.png" border="0" alt="Support CC" /></a></p>
<p>The benefit of donating is the perceived authority to ramble on a little bit longer, and say a few things about what CC are doing what I think could be improved. In order to do that I think its worth looking at the licences as a service (or even a product) that has to be sold to a particular audience and designing it in order to provide maximum value to that audience. What I mean by that is that there is a tendency for organizations to turn inwards &#8211; and in the case of CC that means pay more and more attention to the opinions of legal experts &#8211; rather than listen to the customers who don&#8217;t understand the legal details, and in most cases don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s hat. Here is what I&#8217;d like to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to see fewer licences and fewer versions &#8211; but more certainty that the licence will hold up in court. I believe simplicity beats choice and legal finesse.</li>
<li>I would like to see CC separate its core business (the licences) more clearly from other programme areas and especially things that fall broadly into the fostering of &#8220;creativity (cultural, educational, scientific and other content) in the commons&#8221;. This separation should include budgets &#8211; so that donors can choose what activities their money ends up supporting. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think creativity should be supported, and probably in a fairly vague and flexible way, but I think part of the funding challenge for CC is that people, especially those who are making small donations, are comfortable funding the licences but might not be as comfortable with CC using their donation to foster &#8220;creativity&#8221;. That applies to me for example.</li>
