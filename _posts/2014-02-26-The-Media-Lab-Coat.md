# The MIT Media Lab Coat

I am super happy to announce that we soft launched the [MIT Media Lab Coat site](http://coat.media.mit.edu) yesterday.

It's a project I have been working on almost since arriving at the Lab. I thought it was a crazy idea, I liked the name, and when I met Chris Bevans at the first Director's Fellows meeting and realized he was a fashion designer, I thought it might just work.

Thanks to the hard work of Chris and his team, and Pip Mothersill and Laura Perovich at the Lab, the Lab Coat is becoming a reality. We are currently manufacturing the first 8 prototypes, including one that Joi Ito will wear at [SxSW](http://sxsw.media.mit.edu).

More details are on the [Media Lab Coat website](http://coat.media.mit.edu). 

Special thanks to Srishti Sethi for helping to wrangle the HTML and CSS and integrating the great sign-up feature.
