# Why there are so many videos in online learning, and wy there probably shouldn't be 

The Internet promised us a revolution in learning. What we ended up with looks more like educational TV on small screens. Why is that? And how might we change it?

You can find the whole article <a href="https://medium.com/@medialab/why-there-are-so-many-video-lectures-in-online-learning-and-why-there-probably-shouldn-t-be-2fad009c30b5">here</a>
