# The Cost of Convenience

On the surface, convenience ("the state of being able to proceed with something with little effort or difficulty") is great. It means, we can get more things done more easily.

But there are unintended consequences (or costs) of increased convenience. 

* For learning, more convenience, may ironically mean less learning as the brain has to "struggle" to a certain degree to form new synapses. 

* For navigation, the convenience of GPS means we don't have clear mental models of the locations we move within anymore (and potentially, we lose the ability to form those mental models). 

* When moving around, cars and electric bikes allow us to move faster and further, but we might end up weakening our bodies, because we're not using them as much. 

Ironically, the other meaning of "convenience" is "a public restroom".
