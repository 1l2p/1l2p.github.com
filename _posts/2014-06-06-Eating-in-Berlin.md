(Last update 23/Aug/2017)

A few personal favorites (I'll try to keep the list updated)

**Restaurant 3** - somewhat under the radar, simple and stylish, modern italian fare (my personal favorite in Berlin, highly recommended). Bar 3 next door serves Koelsch (beer from my hometown Cologne) on tap. 

**Cafe Einstein (breakfast)** - A return to cafe house culture. International newspapers. Good breakfast. Two locations (the old one is better).

**Schwarze Traube** New favorite cocktail bar in Berlin. They have four featured cocktails every day (and may accomodate other requests if you ask nicely). [Website/FB](https://www.facebook.com/schwarzetraube1)

**Bar Buck & Breck** (Brunnenstr 177) - Quite a cocktail bar. Tiny and hard to find. Ring the door bell! when they are full, they are full (no waiting list). Don't go with more than 3 people).

**Cookies & Cream** - Expensive stylish vegetarian restaurant, that is attached to a house club. great location, and if you go on a club night, you can enter the party straight from the restaurant, skipping the line and bouncer.

**Bonanza Coffee Roasters** - My favorite of the many hipster coffee shops in Berlin. These guys were the first, and they are still the best and nicest. I hate their competitors The Barn.

**Butter Lindner** With branches all over the city, there is no excuse not to try the amazing "Vanille Quark" (like a very thick and creamy vanilla yoghurt). Also they will custom-make any sandwich. 

## Non Food Favorites

Tempelhof - Redevelopment of the old inner-city airport

R.S.V.P Papier in Mitte - Great little stationary and pen store

Gropius Haus - Rotating exhibitions in historic building 

Hamburger Bahnhof - The "Tate Modern of Germany"
