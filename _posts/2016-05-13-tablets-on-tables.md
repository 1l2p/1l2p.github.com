# New study measures the wrong things to show negative effect of digital tools in the classroom

A new study by MIT colleagues (<a href="https://seii.mit.edu/research/study/the-impact-of-computer-usage-on-academic-performance-evidence-from-a-randomized-trial-at-the-united-states-military-academy/">the study</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/11/students-who-use-digital-devices-in-class-perform-worse-in-exams">the guardian's post about it</a>) on the negative effects of digital tools in the classroom misses the point almost entirely.

It demonstrated that students in an introductory Economics course at West Point performed significantly worse on the class assessments if they were allowed to use laptops, phones or tables during the classes. That seems shocking, and will--no doubt-- be used by those who are critical of digital technology in learning to suggest we should return to a face to face only learning environments.

Haveing digital tools around and using them to access the Internet is distracting. And we know that context switching is killer for cognitive activity. But there are lots of issues with this type of study. It measures success as exam scores. For many types of assessments there is at most a short-term and relatively tenuous relationship between scores and actual learning. In fact, the study finds that "permitting laptops or computers appears to reduce multiple choice and short answer scores, but has no effect on essay scores".

Secondly, the computers were not used to support the learning activities in any way. They were simply permitted as note taking devices. So, the result shows that note taking on a computer or laptop is more distracting than note taking on a piece of paper.

Maybe we should inverse the conclusion and challenge professors, and redesign curriculum to make learning more meaningful and engaging. The course was based around a standard economics textbook with an
online assessments. I doubt that you'd see similar results in a maker space where kids are working on projects that they are passionate about. However, if they are sitting in a lecture that is not particularly well structured, by a professor who simply covers the textbook content, they are more likely to look for distraction. Who can blame them?
