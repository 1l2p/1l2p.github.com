          <h3 class="entry-title">Eureka. It&#8217;s a lab &#8211; not (just) a platform.</h3>
          <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4>
          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>This <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/10/harvard-initiative-learning-teaching-gustave-rita-hauser-gift" target="_blank">announcement</a> about Harvard receiving a US$ 40M gift to support teaching and learning innovation made me think more about the platform conversation we&#8217;ve been having (<a href="index.html%3Fp=709.html" target="_blank">here</a> and on the mailing list). Besides giving an elite university a lot of cash, <strong>how can we foster more innovation in learning and teaching in ways that will affect more people?</strong></p>
<p>It struck me that there isn&#8217;t really an <strong>open lab for learning innovation</strong> &#8211; and that P2PU could be it. During Monday night&#8217;s board meeting we discussed sustainability, and Neeru riffed on the platform idea a bit. She wondered if we could model ourselves as a research institute. There would be heaps of experimentation and research, some of it driven by us and some driven by partners who want to work with us, and each year we would publish a string of short reports about what we are learning. Cathy added that we could connect it to an annual conference with great speakers from the P2PU community who share the results of their work, and suggested that corporations would be willing to pay substantive amounts of money for this knowledge.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the term &#8220;lab&#8221;. Speaking to more people about the idea of a &#8220;platform&#8221; made me realize that it&#8217;s a term that means different things to different people. And when I explained that it was a mechanism to support experimentation and research, they would ask if it was &#8220;kind of like a lab.&#8221; And that&#8217;s exactly what it would it be like.</p>
<p>The idea of an open lab for social learning sounds exciting and it feels in line with our original spirit of experimentation. What would it look like?</p>
<p><strong>Supported by a platform that is extendable, hackable, malleable and customizable</strong> &#8211; We need a sandbox, so that we have a place to experiment, and track the results of these experiments. But the sandbox is not the important piece here, it&#8217;s a means to an end (or a journey rather).</p>
<p><strong>Run by a community that is passionate about peer learning and openness, and thrives on experimentation</strong> &#8211; In her <a href="index.html%3Fp=709.html#comments" target="_blank">comment</a> earlier, <a href="http://twitter.com/kfasimpaur" target="_blank">Karen</a> pointed out that talking about &#8220;platform&#8221; wasn&#8217;t enough and asked &#8220;how do content, community, and methods tie into this?&#8221; She is absolutely right. What happens on the platform is directly connected to the values and principles we hold as a community. I think we need to spend more time talking about what they mean to us &#8211; but our three original values of open, community, and peer-learning have stood the test of time quite well so far.</p>
<p><strong>Turning experiments into great learning experiences for lots of people</strong> - This third bullet is new and still a bit wonky (and needs word-smithing). But it&#8217;s an important stake to put in the ground if we want to make sure our work has a broader benefit. Many research labs have to rely on industry to turn their work into products and services that affect &#8220;normal&#8221; people. As a result success is often measured through proxies for innovation (like scientific articles, or patents, etc.) because the research work is at least one layer removed from the &#8220;end-user&#8221;. Luckily that&#8217;s not the case for us, because the end-user is part of the P2PU community. Why not be bold and try to measure impact through our ability to turn experimentation into great social learning experiences that work for many people?</p>
<p>While Harvard can focus on innovating teaching and learning within the institution &#8211; we could be the open learning lab for everyone. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I believe that one of our greater challenges ahead will be creating clear expectations for new users about our assumed state of experimentation and the freedom that comes with it. Often this freedom has been disconcerting for some learners used to more formally structured environments.</p>

I remember science labs in college and how much I learned there versus watching someone write a bunch of formulas on a board. The same thing can be said for experimentation in this area as well. I know we want to open up some of our metrics and see what can be learned from it. Maybe there are more things we can add to the the code itself to help researchers.</p>
<p>I think P2PU is a great lab for learning for web developers. Not only can we learn by creating a study group or completing the recently added challenges, but we can learn via contributing to the platform itself. It&#8217;s open source and open for pull requests <img src="http://sharing-nicely.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-402" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for your comments. I&#8217;ve also received lots of useful input from the discussion on the P2PU community mailing list and some of the people in our network that I sent this to separately. Main take aways with quick shooting-from-the-hip answers so far (but will turn into another post):</p>
<p>Make sure to spell out what we mean by &#8220;research&#8221; -> My feeling is that small and fast experimentation (try something new, make changes as you learn, and make sure you know early on if it doesn&#8217;t work) will produce better results than long-term carefully designed studies. Those are needed as well &#8211; but I could see a tension between needing to &#8220;hold still&#8221; for so long. </p>
<p>Make sure there is a user friendly version of the platform that is stable -> We need to absolutely make sure that there is a high-quality P2PU.org experience for those users who are coming primarily to learn with others, rather than experiment about learning with others. Great stuff from the lab needs to bubble up into the production site regularly. </p>
<p>Just as two quick responses for now. I&#8217;m really enjoying the process of thinking this through with everyone.</p>
