		<description><![CDATA[Hi Philip

Great post. I came across it while doing some background research for a small project I&#039;m running with our 4th year physiotherapy students.  We&#039;re  trying to evaluate a blogging platform (Wordpress) as a tool for reflection in an Ethics and Human Rights component of the course.

I&#039;m going to try and have a look at the paper you discuss, especially the model for evaluation you mentioned in your post.  Can you suggest any other reading?

Cheers,
Michael

PS.  I&#039;m also running a collaborative group project at http://openphysio.co.za/index.php?title=OpenPhysio:Community_Portal.  I&#039;d love to hear any comments or suggestions you might have.]]></description>
