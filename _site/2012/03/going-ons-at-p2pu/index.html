          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>For those who&#8217;ve been here before you know that I have been fortunate to hold a Shuttleworth Fellowship. One of the (very reasonable) expectations to fellows is to share progress on a quarterly basis. I like to use these occasions to step back and reflect but I&#8217;m on the conference circuit (went from DML straight to SXSWedu and then SXSWInteractive) and will do the reflecting after I get back to Cape Town. A slightly shorter than usual report below:</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> &#8211; The P2PU workshop is a highlight of my year and 2011 was no different. We returned to <a href="../../../index.html%3Fp=717.html" target="_blank">Berlin</a> and a smaller sized group (more similar to 2009) and it was amazing how much we got done. We also dug into the idea of P2PU as a lab and what that means and I am building on those early discussions in my preparation for the April board meeting where I will present the lab strategy to the board. I can&#8217;t stress enough the importance of a vibrant community and I love seeing new things pop up that are driven by community members. More <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/02/14/p2pu-in-het-nederlands-en-espanol/" target="_blank">non-English courses</a> were added including two in Dutch and Webmaking challenges in Spanish. <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/02/04/how-a-poet-learned-to-program/" target="_blank">Poets</a> are learning to hack. And our science friends are <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/02/22/learn-how-to-contribute-to-science/" target="_blank">recruiting more citizen scientists</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong> &#8211; I continue to spend a fair amount of time trying to find, hire, and keep amazing people. So far i&#8217;d say it&#8217;s been successful and I completely love working as part of this awesome team &#8211; and learning new things from them everyday. One of the areas where we were a little under staffed is development and I am happy that we are about to add a full-time software developer to work with Zuzel. Lack of development resources has been a challenge and this will go a long way to addressing that issue. Another realization I&#8217;ve had during the last few months is around the importance of a learning position. Chloe Varelidi has been working with us on badges, assessments, and overall learning design and having someone with her background as part of the team made a huge difference. But she came on board as a consultant and we realized that we really need someone to build out a full-time and long-term position around &#8220;lead&#8221; and grow it into a core pillars of our work. I&#8217;ll write more about what that means shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong> &#8211; John has been doing a great job refining our product development pipeline. On this <a href="https://trello.com/board/project-pipeline/4ec0f020c137ff072a5d8afa" target="_blank">trello</a> board you can see the development projects that are underway. We try to scope things into manageable chunks (2 weeks development time roughly) and eerything goes through a community review process. But we&#8217;ve set it up in a way that still let&#8217;s us get a lot of great input and feedback, but still move fast and not get bogged down in endless discussion. Some of the things we&#8217;ve rolled out in the last months are v2 of the learning challenge model, better badge issuing support, and a redesigned user profile. Much of this work was kick-started at the Berlin workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Schools</strong> &#8211; The new schools are not quite ready for sign-ups yet, but <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/02/08/announcing-the-okfn-p2pu-school-of-data/" target="_blank">School of Data</a> (an initiative we are working on with Open Knowledge Foundation, run by another Shuttleworth Fellow) made a big splash and we are getting close to launching the School of Open together with Creative Commons soon. And School of Ed, a project with HUGE potential, <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/02/03/new-school-of-ed-courses-are-ready-for-signup/" target="_blank">launched</a> its second round of courses.</p>
<p><strong>Party Time</strong> &#8211; We continue to be excited by the &#8220;learning challenges&#8221; model to online learning. So much so that we first had an <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/01/30/were-having-a-party-and-youre-all-invited/" target="_blank">online party</a> that was BYOW (bring your own challenge) and are about to go all real-world. If you are in <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/03/01/p2pu-open-ed-week-challenge-creation-party-live/" target="_blank">London this weekend </a>- come and hang out with Chloe and Bekka and make a learning challenge.  A few good example challenges to get your toes wet are <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/sets/webmaking-101/" target="_blank">these</a>, <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/diy-u-getting-started-with-self-learning/" target="_blank">this one,</a> or <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/writing-for-the-web/" target="_blank">the one</a> over here (Webmaking 101, DIY U, and Writing for the Web respectively).</p>
