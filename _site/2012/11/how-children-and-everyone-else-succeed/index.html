          <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4>
          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Paul Tough&#8217;s recent book &#8220;How Children Succeed&#8221; weaves together a broad body of research with stories of students, teachers, and principals to propose that there is hope for improving the disaster that is education in low-income communities. I am mostly convinced, but have been thinking a lot about the implications of his findings on my own work. </p>
<p><center><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547564651"><img src="http://media.npr.org/assets/bakertaylor/covers/h/how-children-succeed/9780547564654_custom-28a15666a0680a2131148a96e253bf2e019f4092-s15.jpg" border="0"></a><br />
</center></p>
<p>Tough finds that a set of non-cognitive skills, like grit and character, might be more important to help us succeed in life than IQ. The bad news is that traumatic experiences during early childhood can make it hard to develop these skills, which is where low-income kids have a special disadvantage. The good news is that there are ways to learn them later, unlike IQ which is pretty fixed at a relatively young age. </p>
<p>A lot of the research is not new, and for those working in low income communities some of the ideas might seem obvious. Traumatic family environments make it harder for kids to learn. Duh! But even if the problems may be obvious, the solutions have been elusive so far. </p>
<p>Tough describes the challenges, but doesn&#8217;t stop there. He argues that through a series of straight-forward interventions at home and at school, kids can develop non-cognitive skills and habits that will help them succeed in college and life. After many misguided attempts to improve education for those who need it most, Tough&#8217;s book may lead us in a better direction. </p>
<p>There is much in the book that rings true, based on what I have seen in the success of <a href="http://ikamvayouth.org">Ikamva Youth</a> in South Africa. At Ikamva, young university graduates, who come from townships, tutor the next generation of high-school learners and help them enter and succeed in college. The academic support is important, but more important is the ability to imagine a better future, and seeing a clear path that leads there through committed hard work. </p>
<p><strong>What is success?</strong></p>
<p>The book mainly defines success as completing a college degree. A college degree is an ambitious goal for kids in low-income communities, and college degrees are correlated with better health, higher income, and other positive outcomes. Yet somehow, developing the character skills that help us graduate from college, doesn&#8217;t really seem enough. What about creativity, the arts, sparks of invention, or ethics that form our moral compass? </p>
<p>I feel ambivalent about bringing this up. Because, when I read about the aspirations of some of the kids in the book &#8211; being able to get a job, renting a flat, providing a safe space for siblings to grow up &#8211; my arguments why a college degree might not be enough sound hypocritical. I have a degree, and it has made it easier to take for granted things that these kids aspire to, like a job, a flat, and a safe space to life (I also have a pretty impressive track-record of academic dead-ends, but that&#8217;s for another blog post). </p>
<p>That path we travel to get a degree will often include steps that spark our curiosity, help us develop grit, and bring mentors and role models into our lives. Those are the things that count and I would have enjoyed Paul Tough unpack what&#8217;s in the degree a little more &#8211; maybe in his next book?</p>
<p><strong>Beyond grit</strong></p>
<p>Most conversations I have had about the book ended up returning to grit and conscientiousness, because it comes as such a surprise that those are the skills that determine success and not IQ. It worries me that some readers may hone in on grit as the *only* solution. I believe that grit can be a big part of the solution, but it is not enough (and I don&#8217;t think Paul Tough suggests it is enough). </p>
<p>Tough&#8217;s stories of kids who beat the odds are not just about grit. There is something special about the relationships that they have been able to form with mentors, be they parents, other family members, or teachers. Adults approached them with empathy and a true commitment to helping. As a result these kids received the feedback, the critique and the encouragement that they needed. It&#8217;s not grit itself that the book focuses on, but the structures and environments we have to create, to enable kids to develop their sense of grit. </p>
<p><strong>Relating the book to my work</strong></p>
<p>Peer 2 Peer University starts with an interest or a passion to learn something. It operates outside of many of the traditional carrot or stick mechanisms of formal education. And the <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/">Lifelong Kindergarten Group</a> where I am visiting has a great track record or creating environments for creative and interest-driven learning. Real-world spaces like the <a href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/">computer clubhouses</a> or the computing environment <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> allow kids (of all ages) to build, tinker, make mistakes, and to learn from their mistakes. Developing grit hasn&#8217;t been an explicit goal of P2PU or these LLK projects, but I don&#8217;t think that means it isn&#8217;t there. In fact, I think kids and adults who follow their passions and interest, and operate in spaces that allow them create things, often develop extreme persistence. We just don&#8217;t think about grit when we are spending our evenings and weekends trying to solve a problem we deeply care about. We call it grit if it&#8217;s something we&#8217;d rather not do. </p>
<p>I was surprised however that in the book, chess turned out to be an example of something that kids seemed to find such passion for. One wouldn&#8217;t think of chess as very high on the list of interests of teenagers (especially in low-income communities). I&#8217;d be curious to find out more about this example &#8211; is it possible that the school created such a strong culture around its chess program (think football program at a major state college) that the kids were passionate about chess coming into the program, or was there an onboarding process that helped kids discover a passion for chess they may not have known they had? What is that spark &#8211; that ignites a passion for learning? </p>
<p>Fairly harsh critical feedback (coupled with the encouragement to try again) was described as one of the reasons for the success of the chess project. Translating this type of critique into online environments, or more creative learning environments is a challenge we are working on at P2PU. In the case of the chess project, there was a deep sense of trust that was developed over a period of time. On the foundation of that trust and empathy, even hard criticism was accepted and constructive. In online environments we lack many of the clues that signal empathy, and it&#8217;s harder and takes longer to develop trust. That&#8217;s one reason why we often focus on positive and supportive feedback, to help new users develop the confidence to take the next step. At what point does this approach fall short, and the positive feedback actually limits what students will push themselves to achieve? </p>
<p>There was one thing I found truly annoying about the book. While its main focus was on students from low-income communities, it occasionally detoured into the world of posh private schools. The argument was that even there, students sometimes don&#8217;t develop the important skills they need to live fulfilled lives. So what? I couldn&#8217;t really get myself to care about the rich privileged students who didn&#8217;t have enough opportunities to fail. If that drives them into boring careers in banking and law, so be it. </p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> &#8211; Almost nothing in here is just mine. Thanks go to the great folks in the <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/">Lifelong Kindergarten Group</a> at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> whose ideas got all meshed up in my head. This blog post is a great example why the world will be easier (and maybe better) once Nate Mathias has figured out a way to <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/designing-acknowledgment-on-the-web" target="new">make acknowledgement work on the web</a>. </p>

    &#8220;It’s not grit itself that the book focuses on, but the structures and environments we have to create to enable kids to develop their sense of grit.&#8221;<br />
Hopefully people will not rush out to test kids for grit but rather focus on contributing to those structures and environments, including the supportive relationships within them.</p>
<p>The role of relationships in helping youth learn to problem solve and persist&#8211; such as the chess teacher provided&#8211; reminded me of David Hawkins&#8217; essay, &#8220;I, Thou, It&#8221;. How the relationship between teacher and student comes to life when they share a mutual interest and interaction with something in the world.<br />

<p>One update: a 2012 APA task force came to the consensus that IQ (test results) can change much more than had previously been thought (though, again, it comes back to improving environments and reducing the effects of poverty, not teaching to the test).</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-520" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Regarding about the chess club and its members, I think there&#8217;s more at work than passion in chess. I believe for some of these kids this might be a rare experience with an adult who passionately cares about what they&#8217;re doing &#8212; which goes back to the point about relationships. [The "they're in that last sentence is vague. It could be referring to the adult (kids seeing an adult being passionate about something) or the students (students and their activities being cared about by an adult). I think it can be both. Oh English grammer!]</p>
<p>I agree that once you find something you&#8217;re passionate about, you&#8217;re ready to dive in and forgo lots of things (like sleep, friends, eating &#8211; as the chess masters illustrated). However, what if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re passionate about? Where does one go? How can you support others to find their passions, find others with similar interests to support them, and feel confident about yourself and your future in pursuing it? It&#8217;s great that places like the computer clubhouse, scratch, and p2pu exist to encourage people to follow their interests, but what if someone isn&#8217;t lucky enough to stumble into places like that? I guess one hope is that college will help you &#8212; but I&#8217;m not too convinced there. I have lots of friends (including myself) that ended undergrad feeling a bit aimless.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-521" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve been wondering if it would make sense to have &#8220;connected learning&#8221; mentors (to use the MacArthur Foundation phrase) who would help young people find ways to connect their interests and abilities across more aspects of their lives. Co-explorers/ coaches for trying and persisting with possible areas of interest, finding opportunities for them to create, places and people with whom they can learn. </p>
<p>Some young people already have a parent or someone else who does this for them, noticing what they like to do or catches their interest (I mean in small ways), figuring out what they might like to try, what kind of opportunities are available, and coaching them through the process when they encounter obstacles. </p>
<p>Perhaps &#8220;connected learning centers&#8221; could provide resources to support this process. They could be small &#8211; set up in community centers, libraries, schools, museums, or wherever someone is interested in helping connect more youth to opportunities they might appreciate and helping provide perspective on the process&#8211;envisioning &#8220;possible selves&#8221;, realizing they will encounter obstacles, and anticipating or figuring out possible ways to deal with them (as in the Oettingen research mentioned in How Children Succeed and related work by Oyserman on possible selves ). </p>
<p>But then part of me thinks that having a generalized &#8220;connected learning&#8221; mentor and space may not be as useful as having specific arts, chess, maker, dance, science, etc. people and places because it&#8217;s in the specific community of practice that you actually learn the process and make connections. Well, maybe we need both?</p>

Is it a matching challenge, that assumes kids are passionate about specific things and we just have to find the &#8220;right&#8221; thing to ignite their interest in learning? Or is passion a &#8220;habit&#8221; that can be modeled by adults, and that depends less on the topic of passion and more on the possibility of getting absorbed in something &#8230; anything really. </p>
<p>Do we need meta mentors, or should we showcase passionate butchers, lawyers, or engineers who speak about their work with such fire that one can&#8217;t help get inspired?</p>
