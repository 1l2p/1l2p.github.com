You should connect with Andrew Magliozzi who founded http://finalsclub.org and is involved in a number of other interesting ventures. Sounds like an opportunity to collaborate. You can find him at http://twitter.com/pleasestealthis

		<description><![CDATA[Hello!
Thank you for this blog and all your insights on open education and P2PU. I&#039;ve been a fan since the beginning. My name is Mathilde, I&#039;m a French student and former exchange student at UPenn .. I think you met one former professor, Yasmin Kafai, in Seattle.. she teaches Creativity in Education at Penn and we talked about P2PU in class, when we focused on open source education and creativity.

I&#039;m starting a social venture online whose mission is to help  students share their class notes online, in real time with a community of &quot;co-learners&quot; from whom they receive help live. It&#039;s the beginning of the road and I&#039;d love to get insights from you.

Hope to talk to you soon!
