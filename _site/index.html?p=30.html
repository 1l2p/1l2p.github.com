              <p>Joe Richman of Radiodiaries in New York, who did the amazing Nelson Mandela audiomentary, sent this yesterday. The radio diary he did with Thembi Ngubane from South Africa has stirred a lot of interest in the US and Thembi is not returning home for a local tour. If you are in South Africa, make sure to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends of Radio Diaries,</p>
<p>25 years ago today  &#8211; on June 5th, 1981 &#8211; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the first warning about a disease that would become known as AIDS. It is worth taking a moment to think about how we&#8217;ll look back at the epidemic in another 25 years.</p>
<p>This is something that&#8217;s been on our mind for the last few months as we&#8217;ve been touring the country with Thembi and her AIDS Diary.</p>
<p>http://www.radiodiaries.org/aidsdiary</p>
<p>We at Radio Diaries want to thank all of you who helped support Thembi&#8217;s tour. The AIDS Diary project would not have happened without your help. We also thought we would take this opportunity to look back and share a few highlights from the tour.</p>
<p>As many of you know, we met Thembi Ngubane in 2004, at the age of 19, and gave her a tape recorder to keep an audio diary of her life with AIDS. This past April, Thembi&#8217;s AIDS Diary was broadcast as a half-hour documentary on NPR&#8217;s All Things Considered. Thembi&#8217;s story has become much more than a radio documentary. In April and May 2006, Thembi traveled to the US for a five-city tour.  She presented her story to high school and college students, Congressional staff in DC, AIDS doctors in Boston, celebrities in Los Angeles and HIV positive teens in Chicago.</p>
<p>At one presentation to high school students, a teenager pointed to Thembi and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s too pretty to have AIDS.&#8221; After the event, he came up to Thembi and told her, &#8220;I&#8217;m a different person than I was when I came in here.&#8221;  The same can be said for all of us who were part of the tour. Sometimes talking to a few hundred people face-to-face can feel as powerful as reaching 12 million over the airwaves.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights from the tour:</p>
<p>Thembi was interviewed by The Washington Post, AP, Newsweek, and public radio stations across the United States. She recorded a video diary for MTV. And she wrote an essay on living with AIDS for the PBS/Frontline website.  (Articles and links on our website.)</p>
<p>Thembi appeared on CNN as part of a panel of AIDS experts that included former President Bill Clinton, Paul Farmer of Partners in Health, the heads of Pfizer, Worldvision, CARE, Doctors Without Borders, and actor Richard Gere. (Watch a clip on our website.)</p>
<p>We have CNN to thank for Thembi&#8217;s personal tour highlight: spending an afternoon driving around New York City in a limo.</p>
<p>And&#8230; it&#8217;s not over.</p>
<p>In February/March 2007 we will be launching Thembi&#8217;s South Africa tour. We&#8217;ll also be distributing CDs of Thembi&#8217;s AIDS Diary to schools and translating the story into Xhosa and Zulu for broadcast on community radio stations throughout South Africa, and beyond.</p>
<p>Lastly, many of you have asked how you can help Thembi. We have started a campaign to build a house for Thembi and her family. $3,000 has been donated so far and we are trying to raise another $5,000. Find out how you can contribute.</p>
<p>http://www.radiodiaries.org/aidsdiary/donate.html</p>
<p>Visit our newly updated website to hear Thembi&#8217;s story, buy a CD, see photos and highlights from the tour, and learn more about our upcoming AIDS Action Toolkit.</p>

<p>I met in a taxi from Claremont to Khayelitsha in January 2008. Thembi, her boyfriend and I got along like a house on fire in the half an hour we were on the taxi together.</p>
<p>We exchanged numbers and promised to keep in contact. however, i was robbed and lost all contact as my phone and sim card went with the robbers.</p>
<p>When I met them in a cramped back seat of a taxi with four people and their little one that hot summer day, i had no idea who they were and that they were so popular (I think that showed a bit, I dont know).</p>
<p>Please tell her, or preferably her boyfriend Melikhaya to contact Abo on 082 0818 725 anytime. I know that their number starts with 084 and has a recurring number. I cant remember more. They are great people doing great work, and I want to surround myself with such people, because maybe their greatness might rub off on me.</p>
