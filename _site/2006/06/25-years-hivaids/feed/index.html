		<description><![CDATA[Hi there

I met in a taxi from Claremont to Khayelitsha in January 2008. Thembi, her boyfriend and I got along like a house on fire in the half an hour we were on the taxi together.

We exchanged numbers and promised to keep in contact. however, i was robbed and lost all contact as my phone and sim card went with the robbers.

When I met them in a cramped back seat of a taxi with four people and their little one that hot summer day, i had no idea who they were and that they were so popular (I think that showed a bit, I dont know).

Please tell her, or preferably her boyfriend Melikhaya to contact Abo on 082 0818 725 anytime. I know that their number starts with 084 and has a recurring number. I cant remember more. They are great people doing great work, and I want to surround myself with such people, because maybe their greatness might rub off on me.]]></description>
