          <h3 class="entry-title">The darn drop outs and lurkers</h3>
          <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4>
          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>No, I am not speaking of the P2PU management and advisory boards, although some of us have taken rather unconventional academic trajectories including dropping out altogether. But I am writing about a different type of dropping out that is of great concern to P2PU: the number of people that start but don&#8217;t complete online courses, including ours.</p>
<p>When we ran our pilot, many in the P2pU community including myself were shocked to see drop out rates above 50% in most courses. We had some courses where only very few people continued to the end. Our surprise was genuine, but maybe naiv (not a bad thing I would argue). It turns out that our completion rates were no worse (or better unfortunately) than those of online education in general.</p>
<p>I quote from Berge and Huang (who reference others)</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, the percentage of students who drop out of brick and mortar higher education has held constant at between 40-45% for the past 100 years (Tinto 1982). In the online learning context, dropout rates appear to be higher than for traditional courses. While there are no national statistics for completion rates of distance education students, dropout rates are believed by some to be 10 to 20 percentage points higher than for in-person learning (Carr 2000; Diaz 2002; Frankola 2001).</p></blockquote>
<p>That means drop out rates between 50-65% are considered to be a reality in online education. Wow! (I haven&#8217;t done a comprehensive literature review, but some of the articles that are widely referenced are listed at the end of this post.)</p>
<p>I could try to make the argument that this is a success for P2pU &#8211; since our drop out rates are no worse, even though we do not offer any of the usual carrots (degrees) or sticks (fees) that keep people going usually. But unfortunately that would not be good enough. The P2PU learning model is based on a strong sense of community between peers &#8211; individuals who help each other to learn. Seeing peers drop out over time is terribly frustrating not only for the course organizer (I know, because I have spent a significant amount of time on instant messenger with course organizers who felt personally responsible and took each drop out very hard) but also for peer learners, who looser their peers.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2353/2528594807_32a83edee3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Lurking Cat" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2353/2528594807_32a83edee3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>The second argument I come across frequently when drop out rates come up, is that a high percentage of participants in online courses will only <em>lurk</em> and we shouldn&#8217;t worry about that. There is a whole book shelf of academic literature on <em>learning by lurking</em> and the <em>invisible student</em>. I am not arguing that lurkers are not learning anything, but in my personal experience and that of P2PU, it is not the lurkers that benefit most but the doers, the tinkerers and the creators &#8211; and that those are the people you will want to take a course with. It&#8217;s no fun to be in a room full of invisible students.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why P2PU is aiming for low drop out and lurking rates. Very low ones. It&#8217;s always dangerous to nail your colors to the mast, but I would go so far to say that in the perfect P2PU course, less than 10% of participants drop out or don&#8217;t participante. (Please note that this is me speaking in my personal capacity &#8211; and not necessarily the opinion of the P2PU community!)</p>
<p>I think there are many aspects of online courses that can be improved to reduce drop out rates and increase participation, but two fundamental things that enable us to shift from more than 50% leaving to something much better:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make it difficult (to join)</strong> &#8211; In our pilot phase (as well as the first round of courses we ran this year), it was too easy to sign-up for a course. As a result many people signed up because the courses &#8220;sounded interesting&#8221; without really asking themselves if they were ready to make the commitment necessary. By increasing the sign-up hurdle, we can help users think more carefully about joining a course. This hurdle should not be designed to test expertise or intellectual capacity, but motivation. If someone puts in a few hours of work to complete and submit their course sign-up form &#8211; they should be allowed to join.</li>
<li><strong>Make it personal</strong> &#8211; The interaction between participants is crucial in creating a social bond that helps people keep going when their busy lives pull them in other directions. One participant in the pilot stated that she knew one of the other participants by name (and assumed the same was true in the other direction). She said she struggled to keep up with the work, but pulled through and completed because she didn&#8217;t want her colleague to think she was a quitter. By increasing personal interaction at the beginning of the course, the social ties between participants can be strengthened. Asking participants to upload photos of themselves helps with identification &#8211; and as we feel ourselves learning more about others, we assume they learn more about ourselves &#8211; and we start caring about their opinions.</li>

Just by way of contrast, you might also consider turning the options upside-down. Instead of &#8220;making it difficult (to join)&#8221; how about &#8220;making it easy (to leave)&#8221;? I&#8217;m not sure low drop-out rates are a valuable goal for a new kind of learning. Seems like the model might instead be one where there are lots of dabblers and very few completers. Would that be bad?<br />

Why not have two levels: &#8216;read-only&#8217; for lurkers, and full participation for active students? Make it easy to go between the two roles, but hard to stay an active student if you&#8217;re not active.</p>

I cannot, however, agree with the acquiescence of lurkers and drop-outs for a peer-based model. Peer to peer learning requires insistence on communal participation. Transferal of this concession towards atrophy as a cultural norm would do tremendous harm in a peer-based learning environment. I feel aligned with Philipps ideas about promoting participation in peer-to-peer courses.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-107" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hey Gary, Phorque, Alison &#8211; I really appreciate your thoughtful comments, thanks!</p>
<p>I think the disagreement is actually more a misunderstanding related to the difference between P2PU and &#8220;normal&#8221; online education. For Alison and myself it&#8217;s implicit that in P2PU all content and interaction between peers are open &#8211; as a result everyone can lurk by default (everyone has &#8220;read-only&#8221; access as phorque puts it) and we completely encourage that. So, we are pro lurking.</p>
<p>However, once someone becomes a participant in the course (a learning peer) that person takes on a different status. She/he takes up resources &#8211; in terms of time from the course organizer as well as the other peers. And I would argue that joining a P2PU course constitutes agreeing to a social contract &#8211; of supporting each other throughout the course.</p>
<p>Gary&#8217;s concept of dabblers is intriguing and I am not sure where I stand on this (assuming that a dabbler could participates in half of the course, but bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm, and then float away). That is not necessarily a bad thing. Although I would argue that it does lower the strength of social ties and might cause more confusion and frustration than benefit.</p>

<p>Many people complete courses because of financial pressure (having paid for a year at university) or social pressure (friends and parents). If they could have opted out without too many consequences and pursue something better suited, then completing a course could be wasting time.</p>

<p>Where I slightly diverge from Dirk&#8217;s point is that even though the reason for someone to drop out might not be a problem, their leaving the course community will have a negative effect on other peer learners.</p>
<p>But we should be able to make it easier for users to decide if they want to take a particular course or not. This includes a better description of what it means to take a P2PU course, and a detailed outline of the course content including assignments and tasks. I think they main challenge is the first point &#8211; conveying how P2PU courses work &#8211; because by definition all of our course content is free and open anyway. We are currently working on a short list of bullet points that would help users understand what is expected of them &#8211; and we are considering some kind of social contract that users enter with the other peer learners when they join a course.</p>
<p>Do you think that would address some of the issues?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-111" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There&#8217;s always going to be a gap between a student&#8217;s intentions and their follow-through, and I don&#8217;t think this only affects online courses. I&#8217;d be very interested to learn what the retention rates look like among students auditing a course in a university setting. Without the pressure of grades and course credit, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if those rates are comparable to what you&#8217;re seeing now.</p>
<p>That said, I think that there are lots of possibilities to explore here. Dirk identified two of the forces in action in university courses: social pressure and financial pressure. It may be worth trying variations of both of these in P2PU courses. Perhaps each course could carry a (nominal) fee, which is fully refunded upon completion of the course. As for social pressure, I think this is most effective when it comes from people you know. For the course description that I just submitted for the School of Webcraft, I tried to leverage that: &#8220;&#8230;Our approach is highly collaborative, so we&#8217;d encourage you to take this course with a friend or two.&#8221; I&#8217;m interested to see if that helps.</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the issue stems from the tension between being an online community and holding an online class. The people who initial lurk at the edges of the P2PU network may slowly, over time, drift towards the more active core. Each class, however, has a fixed beginning and ending date, and the goal is for everyone in the group to be present and participating for the duration of the course. Dron and Anderson make a distinction between the structure of groups and networks: <a HREF="http://terrya.edublogs.org/2007/04/30/on-groups-networks-and-collectives/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> and subsequent <a HREF="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11231942989638951292&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000" rel="nofollow">paper</a>). I&#8217;ve found this to be useful, and you may, too.</p>
