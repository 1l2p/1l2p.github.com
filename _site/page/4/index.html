          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>MIT OCW just launched its first five <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ocw-scholar/">MIT OCW Scholar courses</a>. These courses are not just openly licensed, but especially designed to support independent learners who want to make use of them. That means, all the materials you need to master the subjects are now available to you. Bravo!</p>
<p>Despite its resounding success (70 million visitors so far) I have often heard criticism that MIT OCW wasn&#8217;t going far enough, that it was too focused on content only without thinking about the learner, and that many of its courses were incomplete. The thing is, that I don&#8217;t think MIT disagreed with any of these statements.<em> Not all the materials were included, because the original OCW wasn&#8217;t designed for independent self-learners</em> who would need all the materials openly available &#8211; it was designed for instructors and students, who would have access to journal articles and books through their libraries. </p>
<p>Thanks to ongoing efforts to collect data and feedback from users (MIT is one of very few open education projects <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/about/site-statistics/">that publishes stats and comprehensive evaluation</a> reports) it became clear that the largest group of users was not students and lecturers, but independent learners. Stepping back from the direct MIT perspective, and looking at the global open education ecosystem -<em> it is quite amazing to see this amount of demand for course materials that come without a certificate or degree</em>. It also presented a fantastic opportunity to go even further than OCW had gone so far as an enabler for global learning. </p>
<p>The basic materials and course structures were already in place as part of OCW. <em>What was missing were background documents, mainly textbooks or textbook replacements, more detailed instruction on assessment and how to make sure one had mastered the expected objectives of the course.</em> And that is what the MIT OCW Scholar courses provide &#8211; in addition to video lecturers by some of the world&#8217;s leading experts in their fields (who <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-2010">at least in this case </a>happens to be an amazing lecturers as well).</p>
<p>Another thing that was missing were <em>the people to learn with</em>. MIT recently started linking some of their courses to <a href="http://openstudy.com/study-groups/OCW%20Scholar%20-%20Physics%20I:%20Classical%20Mechanics?version=feed:blue-button&#038;referrer=ocw%20scholar%20-%20physics%20i:%20classical%20mechanics&#038;version=feed:blue-button">OpenStudy communities</a> for questions and answers, and the Scholar courses are included. While the integration is still at the course level &#8211; and not connected to detailed components of the course &#8211; I believe that is in the works for the future. Having a space to collaborate with others, discuss questions and get support, adds to the value that MIT OCW offers already.</p>
<p>The integration with missing materials, and other learners presents <em>a great opportunity for the entire OpenCourseWare movement</em>. Partnering with small projects that innovate outside of institutional structures can help get us there. At P2PU we have been working on a few ideas how independent and informal study groups can be integrated with OCW materials &#8211; and how a feedback mechanism would bring back value to the original OCW authors and institutions. But that deserves a separate blog post. </p>
<p>For now &#8211; <strong>congratulations MIT</strong> for once again pushing the boundaries of how institutions can open up access to their materials, and processes, to create more opportunities for learning. </p>

              <p>Voila. Another insightful and funny artwork by P2PU&#8217;s illustrator-in-residence and grungefarmer <a href="http://www.grungefarmer.org/">Alison Jean Cole</a> (and referencing <a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/">John Britton</a>&#8216;s encyclopedic knowledge of Steve Colbert&#8217;s work).

<p>The not entirely joking background to this illustration comes from UC Berkeley. <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/erinknight">Erin Knight</a>, who runs a Research Centre at the <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">iSchool</a> and works with P2PU/Mozilla on badges and assessment hosted an event on the &#8220;Future of Teaching and Learning.&#8221;. She took participants through a SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis and P2PU came up in the discussion.</p>
<p>But in which part of SWOT P2PU came up was a surprise. You&#8217;d think P2PU is an O, an opportunity for UC Berkeley to investigate how online social learning could expand what it does so well already. But no, P2PU came up as a T, a threat to the future of teaching and learning at UC Berkeley?</p>
<p>Now, while for a moment it is a little flattering to think of ourselves as a threat to UC Berkeley, it&#8217;s also ridiculous, and a little sad.  It indicates that at least for some in the accredited institutions &#8211; innovative and experimental approaches to probing the future of teaching and learning, like P2PU, are threats, and not opportunities. </p>
<p>We ended up having an interesting conversation about this on the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-community'>p2pu-community list</a>. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&#8217;s funny, there is a definite comfort in being the underdog in a way! What happens when p2pu is mainstream? Or put another way, what does p2pu in the mainstream look like so as not to fall prey to the same tunnel vision thinking that there is only one way? </em>(Jessy)</li>
<li><em>I think the most important thing we can do is to keep the eyes on the real goal &#8211; which is to radically expand everyone&#8217;s access to a quality learning experience (and having a lot of fun in the process)&#8230;</em> (Stian)</li>
<li><em>I think some people see p2pu as a threat b/c it symbolizes a breakdown of the way things have worked forever, where the institution has all the control.  p2pu represents (among many things)(to me) giving learners control, providing them with other pathways to quality learning.</em> (Erin)</li>
</ul>

          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>This is my second post as part of the Open Governance course at P2PU. <a href="http://leighblackall.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Leigh Blackall</a> generously agreed to facilitate the week &#8211; by posting <a href="http://p2pu.org/node/5618/forums/10254" target="_blank">a set of background resources, and asking questions</a> &#8211; about the difference between online projects that are &#8220;groups&#8221; versus &#8220;networks&#8221; and if governance is an appropriate framework to think about online projects. He asks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is governance an appropriate framework for thinking about online projects?</li>
<li>Will the desire to organise, centralise and ultimately govern, always be a need for people in an online future?</li>
<li>Is the individualism implicit in networks too problematic for people with cultural, family or political backgrounds that value collective identities?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have struggled with the questions, because they rely on definitions of &#8220;group&#8221; and &#8220;network&#8221; that I find flawed. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephen_downes/252157734/" target="_blank">This whiteboard diagram</a> created by Stephen Downes provides a quick overview. According to the diagram, <em>groups</em> are inherently closed, coordinated by leaders (who hold centralized power) and distribute information in a trickle down way. <em>Networks</em> on the other hand are diverse, open, and distributed rather than distributing. Groups have vision statements; networks don&#8217;t. To me this dichotomy and especially the loaded definition of the term <em>group</em> doesn&#8217;t make sense or reflect the reality of online collaboration. <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=35885" target="_blank">At least one commenter</a> felt the same way, which makes me hope I am not completely on the wrong track:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You create a straw dog in groups and then go on to attack it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, by using these definitions (which I don&#8217;t agree with) we seem to get distracted from the key question that I find useful in the context of open governance, which is &#8220;How can individuals who have overlapping goals, collaborate with each other online in order to achieve them?&#8221;</p>
<p>1. Is governance an appropriate framework for thinking about online projects?</p>
<p>Yes it is. To add even more definitions to this blog post, I think it is especially useful if we define it broadly as the processes by which groups of individuals make decisions and take actions, and the structures through which these processes are implemented. I think this is quite different from the way Leigh uses the term. If I understand him correctly, he focuses on the process and structure through which some individuals govern other individuals. Nevertheless even if we considered governance in a narrow sense, I still find it an important lens through which to look at online projects, because governance will shape how these projects operate, and what they achieve &#8212; both collectively and for the individuals involved.</p>
<p>2. Will the desire to organise, centralise and ultimately govern, always be a need for people in an online future?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that there is an innate desire in everyone to &#8220;centralise&#8221; or &#8220;ultimately govern&#8221; other people; and online projects seem to show that the opposite is the case. Barriers to entry and exit are low, often it is just a matter of creating a user account (if that) and deciding to spend time on contributing to a project or not. Individuals can therefor choose to contribute to those communities that have structures and processes they find useful. This doesn&#8217;t mean individuals will not enter communities that have centralized governance structures, but they will do so only if they see a clear trade-off. Couch-surfing (www.couchsurfing.com) is an example, where many of the core decisions are taken by a few individuals, with very limited ability of community members to influence the decisions. I suspect that individual couch-surfers don&#8217;t really care as long as the platform let&#8217;s them do what they want - which is communicate with other couch-surfers. However, if there were two similar couch surfing communities, one that has transparent and inclusive governance mechanisms, and the other that is centralized and closed, more users will find the first option more attractive.</p>
<p>This is certainly an approach we are taking at P2PU. The only way to grow the project is to let a community of passionate individuals take it forward. That means actively reaching out to individuals and inviting them to take ownership and responsibility, rather than making decisions top-down,  and letting the project evolve in ways that might be unexpected to those of us who started it.</p>
<p>3. Is the individualism implicit in networks too problematic for people with cultural, family or political backgrounds that value collective identities?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think individualism is too problematic, or even related to individual backgrounds (which here seems to mean values or preferences). P2PU is a community of individuals that have overlapping values and objectives. In our communication with each other, we focus on those areas where our objectives overlap &#8211; there are lots of other areas and interests that we don&#8217;t share or coordinate.</p>
<p>This is a long post already, and I will close here, but it will be useful to come back and look at some of the insightful observations that Stephen and Leigh make in their broader networks vs. groups argument (I find many of their points very useful, even if I disagree with the definitions, and consider the way the argument is set-up distracting). What are the implications of openness, autonomy, or diversity on the ability of projects like P2PU to make decisions? In a concrete example, how does P2PU decide how to spend its limited resources? Who should be involved in that decision, and in what way?</p>

          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>This is my first posting for the Open Governance course, which I am both facilitating and participating in (yes, peer learning at its best). The assignment, readings and links to other participants&#8217; posts are all on this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://p2pu.org/node/5618/forums/9614" target="_blank">http://p2pu.org/node/5618/forums/9614</a></p>
<p>I wont&#8217; go into a lot of detail on the content of the readings, but they deal with community behavior observed among baboons in East Africa, where norms fundamentally changed due to an external influence, and remained robust over time. I take away two starting points from the radiolab programme for our discussion of open governance.</p>
<ul>
<li>New and fundamentally different community norms can emerge suddenly (and by accident) and don&#8217;t require slow evolutionary processes.</li>
<li>The new community norms thus established, can remain robust even when new members join the community, who are used to the traditional norms and behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question of norms and values, and how they are conveyed to new members of a community are important for all organizations, but more so in open communities. There are at least two reasons for this. Open communities show higher levels of fluidity in membership. New participants constantly join communities, and others leave, and there are usually few opportunities for formal &#8220;orientation&#8221;. Different from traditional firms, norms and values are not fixed by hierarchical power structures and rarely questioned. On the contrary, the community constantly engages with them in action and discourse.</p>
<p>All communities have norms and practicies (&#8220;the way we do things around here&#8221;) even if they might not be clearly articulated or expressed. And even if they are articulated somewhere, they might still not be obvious to newcomers. As in the baboon example newcomers join a community with their own set of values and behaviors, and with expectations regarding the community norms, and might lack interest or skill to observe and adapt to existing community norms. The baboons required a &#8220;mentor&#8221; to help them figure out what was different. Interestingly, for the baboons this mentor&#8217;s role was mainly to comfort the new joiner &#8211; rather than lecture or instruct them on how they should behave.</p>
<p>The set of questions this raises for me, is related to the strategies that open communities will take with respect to newcomers. Are these strategies designed to make new joiners feel comfortable and at ease, and does that work in open communities as well as it does for baboons? (I realize I am moving on increasingly thin ice here &#8211; &#8220;Schmidt calls open source developers apes?&#8221; &#8211; I am not doing that!)</p>
<p>If our hypothesis is that communities will take different strategies to convey prevailing norms, and that they react differently when norms are questioned, or attacked, it would be interesting to look at a few examples in a little more detail.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that on the P2pU-community mailing list, we have seen a lot of the good baboon like behavior. When new joiners introduce themselves, or are introduced by an existing subscriber, there is usually a flurry of emails responding to their interests and just saying &#8220;hello &#8211; great to see you here.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t thought about it in these terms, but I think those first messages go a long way towards making people feel at ease, and appreciated and as a result there is little risk they will act defensively.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&#8217;ve had a few occasions where community members sent short or terse emails that sometimes cut discussion short. I received messages off list from community members who stated they weren&#8217;t replying to emails that seemed negative and not constructive. As a result I kept a eye on messages from the person who had been sending these emails and would have contacted them off list if the same dynamics had continued. Fortunately, the tone of the emails was mostly related to stress that had nothing to do with P2PU and evened out after a little while. For me, it was great that the community had a self-warn system where individual members would first flag a potential problem off-list. What we haven&#8217;t had to deal with is to resolve this kind of conflict on the list, and that will be a real test.</p>
<p>I am running out of time here, but I remember a Google Tech talk about dealing with difficult developers joining an open source community and it would be useful to go back to the talk and compare the suggested strategies, to the &#8220;make them feel comfortable&#8221; approach discussed here. Has anyone else seen this and might still have the link?</p>
<p>Great week 1 and it&#8217;s a challenge to keep up the reading and writing. But learning doesn&#8217;t come for free!</p>

          <h3 class="entry-title"><a href="../../index.html%3Fp=665.html" rel="bookmark">Open Governance &#8211; How can open communities make good decisions and get stuff done?</a></h3>
          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>At <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>, we pride ourselves in being an open education community. I have a fairly good idea what it means for <a href="http://creativecommons.org">content</a> or <a href="http://fsf.org">software</a> to be open, but I find the complex human dynamics that make up open communities much more intriguing than the arguments over which license is the right one. And so, over the past year, I have enjoyed exploring what it means to be an <em>open community</em>, by helping shape the developments at P2PU. What are the structural differences between open communities and closed ones? What is good leadership in open communities? How can groups of volunteers make decisions efficiently and get stuff done? In a nutshell, how does open governance work? I want to better understand these questions and find answers that help P2PU remain the healthy, vibrant and wonderful community it is today, and enable the next phase of expected growth.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks two things have happened that will go a long way towards achieving this goal. P2PU started talking to <a href="http://oneclickor.gs">One Click Orgs</a> and I decided to run a <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Open-Governance">P2PU course on open governance</a>, so that I could ask some of my questions more formally and find others who might be interested to explore them together.</p>
<p><strong>One Click Orgs</strong> helps open communities to set up governance structures that allow them to become legal entities (with all the security and power that comes with that &#8211; actually little power, and a lot of hassle) while preserving their essential dynamic and participatory nature. They started working with UK community organizations, are currently applying their ideas, technology and model to a UK charity (a non profit organization), and are excited to look at doing the same with us for a US based 501(c)(3) (same thing, non profit organization, but different country and laws). I had been struggling with the idea of establishing all the traditional rules and structures that typical non-profit organizations have, because they felt so foreign to the way things worked at P2PU. And I was worried that by creating structures, we would invariably change the dynamics. It was wonderful to hear <a href="http://charlesarmstrong.net/">Charles Armstrong</a> from One Click Orgs articulate exactly these kinds of issues &#8211; and even go one step further and explain how much of the paper-based procedures that are required by law, and which are highly annoying, can actually be virtualized using the open web.</p>
<p><strong>Open Governance course.</strong> In this coming <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/New-Courses">round of P2PU courses</a> (sign-up opens next week <strong>25 August</strong> &#8211; mark the date!) I will facilitate a <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Open-Governance">course on open governance</a>. If you are interested in working together on some of these questions, please consider signing up. If you have some thoughts or experiences to share, but are too busy to commit to the whole course, please do get in touch with me anyway &#8211; or leave comments and feedback on the evolving course outline. I am only starting to structure this study of open governance, but there are three concepts that seem like good vantage points from which to explore open governance: transparency, leadership, and participation.</p>
<p>Before going into these ideas in more detail, I thought I&#8217;d post a few notes on how P2pU makes decisions today. Looking at the structures that have evolved it is easy to see the tension between the underlying principles and values and the pragmatic realities of trying to move quickly and efficiently. Of course, the argument around efficiency is the most common, but possibly also the worst excuse to not be open. Anyways, P2PU currently has two spheres of governance. An open community mailing list that is open to all, but in practice the people who lead the discussion and work out the details of what P2PU is and does are a small group of committed volunteers (referred to informally as the gang-stars, because of the original mailing list that was titled &#8220;the gang&#8221;). And there is a second list for the five founders, that is closed and private, where we discuss things that are difficult to do in a public forum &#8211; questions about money, strategic partnerships that are just emerging, and ideas that could be fairly significant for P2PU and need a first reality check before one explores them further.</p>
<p><strong>So what are some of the things we are rubbing up against (these are examples for the kinds of things I would like to discuss in more detail in the course)?</strong></p>
<p>The gang list used to be private (but not really closed as anyone who made a significant contribution was invited to join) and a wonderful space for discussion. There was an awesome sense of community, camaraderie, and the conversations freely ranged from very high-level philosophical ideas about the future of education, to the color of the button on the home page. Amidst a lot of good natured joking the vibe was extremely respectful and tolerant. As P2PU grew we started rubbing up against the limitations of having a safe, but fairly small space that was reserved for people who had already made a contribution. Many of us would meet interesting people at conferences, who would have great perspectives and ideas to contribute, but there would be no way to easily bring them into the community discussion. We we were worried about loosing the vibe of the gang list, but decided together that opening it up was the only solution. Now p2pu-community has a new name and anyone can sign up. It is difficult to say what has changed &#8211; maybe it is a little bit less wacky, and maybe some of us are a little more guarded in our comments &#8211; but the &#8220;community&#8221; does feel a little different from the &#8220;gang&#8221;. But even if it is not just the illusion of my sentimental memory, I also see that the benefits of the open community list are much more obvious. It is now much easier for amazing people like <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/joe-corneli/9/1b/663">Joe</a> and <a href="http://jessykate.posterous.com/">Jessy</a> to just sign-up, chime in and help us do more things better.</p>
<p>One thing that worked well on the council list (remember, closed and private for founders) was our ability to make decisions quickly and efficiently, and the trust that we had in each other&#8217;s vision and integrity. The problem is that the amount of decision making required started becoming overwhelming &#8211; and that for some of the questions we had originally discussed in the council list, it turned out we were maybe not the best ones to discuss or decide (or at least not without more people involved). We haven&#8217;t made any changes to the council list yet, but in the coming months, we will try to understand how it too can evolve &#8211; in the same way that the gang has. In the context of incorporation, we have to also clarify its role and responsibilities with respect to a board of directors, who are legally responsible for the organization (and required by law in the US). So &#8230; I think it&#8217;s clear that there are many more fascinating and challenging questions ahead and I hope some of you will be interested in joining me to explore them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mozilla School of Webcraft at P2PU</strong></p>
<p>Web developer training that’s free, open and globally accessible.</p>
<p>Mozilla and Peer 2 Peer University are creating the P2PU School of Webcraft, a new way to teach and learn web developer skills. Our classes are globally accessible, 100% free, and powered by learners, mentors and contributors like you. Our goal is to provide a free pathway to skills and certification to help people build careers on open web technology.</p>
<p>Existing developer training is expensive, out of touch, and out of reach. We leverage peer learning powered by mentors and learners like you and self-organized study groups. We use existing open and free learning materials.</p>
<p>In this sixty minute session we&#8217;ll briefly cover the inception of the Peer 2 Peer University along with details and success stories from the first three cycles of courses. We&#8217;ll then dive into more detail about our collaboration with Mozilla Drumbeat including Mozilla&#8217;s mission to engage the next million Mozillians. We&#8217;ll present the P2PU School of Webcraft, and a case study of courses offered so far, including the first course, &#8216;Mashing Up the Open Web.&#8217; Additionally, we&#8217;ll introduce our plans to separate learning from assessment and our community driven credentialing system.</p>
<p>At the end of the session we will invite the audience, and all of SXSW, to join a course on open web skills to be offered during the week of the event. Read more: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/one_pager">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/one_pager</a></p></blockquote>

              <p>Smack into the middle of summer break in the global North (and beautiful sunny winter days in Cape Town) comes the P2PU Call for Courses. We already asked for your ideas on Webdeveloper courses for the <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/p2pu-webcraft">School of Webcraft</a> a few weeks ago, and this is the call for courses by everyone, for everyone, about almost anything. <strong>Surprise us!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The Peer 2 Peer University is gearing up to launch its third cycle of courses this coming September, and we’re looking for new faces to join the community. Do you have an idea for a six week course? Whether it’s Physics 101 or Poker and Strategic Thinking, all ideas are welcome. You can propose a course at <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Create-a-Course" target="_blank">http://wiki.p2pu.org/Create-a-Course</a> (deadline is August 6, 2010).</p>

          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>For the <a href="http://p2pu.org/webcraft">P2PU School of Webcraft</a> we are working on a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/Open_Web_Competency_Map#Competency_Map">map of competencies</a> that web developers need. Besides the soft skills we refer to as hacker&#8217;s habits, there is a whole range of technologies and practical skills. A few months ago I had the chance to hold a box of crayons for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Blizzard" target="_blank">Chris Blizzard</a> and <a href="http://arunranga.com/blog/" target="_blank">Arun Ranganathan</a> from Mozilla who came up with this original map of the open web.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Map of the Open Web" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4022/4463166405_e4b319a999.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>While inspiring (and confusing) we needed something a little more electronic &#8211; so that others can edit/iterate on it, and we can refine it easily as we learn more about the competencies that our graduates want and how to map them against the courses we are offering.</p>
<p>Since I am interested in graphs and this is a problem I have encountered before, I spent a little time investigating our options (mostly by sending out questions to people smarter then myself and trying to understand their answers). I ruled out using a diagram editor that has no underlying logical representation of the graph &#8211; in other words, it&#8217;s not a graph, it&#8217;s a drawing of a graph &#8211; since drawings don&#8217;t evolve in sync with the underlying data. With that out of the way, there seemed to be two main alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a Mindmap &#8211; There are a number of g<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mind_mapping_software">ood open source projects</a> that look suitable to the task. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a standard file format yet and the easiest would have been to agree on one application and use its native file format. There are also some nice online mindmap tools that let you store the mindmap in the cloud so that a group of people can edit it and you don&#8217;t have to deal with versioning and sending files around.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php">.dot language</a> to create the graph structure and a visualization tool to make it look pretty. This seemed the more compelling way to go, because we have more flexibility of the graph structure, it&#8217;s really simple to get started (but can get very complex if you want), and anyone can edit it using nothing but a simple text editor (there is <em>only one editor</em> of course, and that&#8217;s VIM :-))</li>
</ul>
<p>The .dot file looks something like the following (click <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/Open_Web_Competency_Map/dot_file">here</a> to see the complete file):</p>
<p><code> graph G {</code></p>
<p><code>e [shape=ellipse, label="HTML", style=bold];<br />
f [shape=ellipse, label="What is markup?"];<br />
g [shape=ellipse, label="Basics of Layout"];<br />
h [shape=ellipse, label="Document order vs. display order"];<br />
e -- f;<br />
e -- h;</code></p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p><code>....<br />
</code></p>
<p>While I was working on the graph structure, I used the excellent OSX implementation of <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to check my work. The fact that Graphviz seems to be getting a new boost of input &#8211; I think the original author managed to move the project to AT&amp;T &#8211; was another selling point for using this solution.</p>
<p>However, we also thought it made sense to have a slightly more polished (with colors!) version of the map that we could show to non geeks. I downloaded a trial version of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> (and am very tempted to purchase a license) which let&#8217;s you open a .dot file and then manipulate the graph. Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t make changes and export them back as .dot, but I didn&#8217;t really need to do that anyway.</p>
<p>Here is the &#8220;pretty&#8221; version made with OmniGraffle:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/Open_Web_Competency_Map#Competency_Map"><img class="aligncenter" title="Pretty version" src="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/thumb/2/2f/Mapofopenweb.png/700px-Mapofopenweb.png" alt="" width="560" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>If you need a text based graph structure, but also want nice looking graph visualizations &#8211; this might be a solution that works for you as well.</p>
<p>Update: The ultimate solution would be an import of our .dot file into <a href="http://thejit.org/demos/">this</a> (thanks <a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/">John</a>!).</p>

<p>Call for course organizers is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mozilla and Peer 2 Peer University are creating the P2PU School of Webcraft, a great place to learn the craft of open and standards-based web development.</p>
<div>This coming September we&#8217;ll be launching our first cycle of six week courses including Introduction to HTML5 and Building Social with the Open Web. We still have space for a few more courses, so whether you can teach a class for novice web developers, or run a workshop for web developers managing thousands of user accounts, we&#8217;d love to have you involved.</p>
<p>Following on the delivery model developed by P2PU, course organizers volunteer to take existing open learning materials or develop their own content and lead a group of peers through 6 weeks of online classes. Courses focus on project based learning in a peer environment and are proposed, created and led by members of the web development community – so the content will always be up to date with the latest technologies.</p>
<p>Over the next 18 months we&#8217;ll be developing a new way of assessing and recognizing skills, hacker attitudes and knowledge that rewards project portfolios and realistic developer challenges, rather than hours spent cramming for a meaningless exam.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love for you to become a part of this project and until July 18 we&#8217;re inviting course proposals for P2PU School of Webcraft. We&#8217;ve made it really easy to get started, just fill out the proposal form, it takes less than 5 minutes!</p>
