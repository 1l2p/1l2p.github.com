              <p>I&#8217;ve been looking for solutions to two problems that must be quite common for people working in virtual teams</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing sprawling lists of todos across many projects</li>
<li>Keeping track of where all my time goes to make sure I&#8217;m spending it on things that are important</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;d think there must be a plethora of great simple tools that make this easier. I&#8217;ve looked (and have been looking) but the tools are either too complex (insert name of any task management app of your choice) or too simple (<a title="teuxdeux.com" href="http://teuxdeux.com/list" target="_blank">teuxdeux</a>).</p>
<p>Please someone build this. I&#8217;ll beta-test and help spread the word. Here is the minimum Viable Product</p>
<p>A task has the following fields</p>
<ul>
<li>Short description (this covers name, title, etc.)</li>
<li>Time to complete (how long I think it will take, or how long it ended up taking me)</li>
<li>Completed (checkbox to show what&#8217;s done and what still needs doing)</li>
<li>Tags (for everything else: grouping by project, types of tasks, priority, deadlines, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<div>Only one view -&gt; Dashboard (toggle Current / History)</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Toggle between</li>
<ul>
<li>All the tasks that are not complete yet</li>
<li>All the tasks that have been completed</li>
</ul>
<li>I can order/filter them by any of the above fields</li>
<li>I can add/edit/delete tasks</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Cross-platform</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;d prefer to run it as a desktop application, but web-app would also be fine</li>
<li>And there is no way around mobile support, so at some point it&#8217;ll need an IOS and Android version (good way to make money and keep the desktop/web-app free)</li>

          <h3 class="entry-title"><a href="../../index.html%3Fp=709.html" rel="bookmark">Why P2PU should be a platform and not a product</a></h3>
          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>I&#8217;ve had a lot on my mind with regards to P2PU recently. Bear with me for a bit of a meander &#8230;</p>
<p>As Executive Director, one of my responsibilities is to figure out a way to make this thing sustainable, and I&#8217;m working on a sustainability plan for discussion with the board. Lots of people have been suggesting opportunities for earned income (charging for something) and I am excited by some of them. But when users pay for services they become customers, and customers are different from community members. Nadeem deserves credit for really pushing on the importance of <strong>tying sustainability to the value we create for our community</strong> and I think he is right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been wondering about the applicability of the &#8220;challenges&#8221; model to other areas besides the <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank">Mozilla School of Webcraft</a>. I think it&#8217;s a really awesome model to scale social learning for some users and communities. But Jessy&#8217;s post about looking at learning as heterogenous vs. homogeneous systems reminded me of the <strong>passion I&#8217;ve always felt for the diversity and serendipity of stuff at P2PU</strong>, and how we need to balance the desire to create an amazing polished experience with the possibility for experimental, messy, and unexpected things to evolve.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of planning our third P2PU workshop and I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the first P2PU workshop two years ago. Berlin 09/09/09 forged an amazing spirit of possibility and community that has carried us a long way. Berlin 11/11/11 will be much more focused on concrete work, but the important questions remain the same. What role should P2PU play (in an open education world that looks very different from two years ago)? What makes us different? One of <a href="http://www.jessicaledbetter.com/" target="_blank">Jessica&#8217;s</a> emails to the development list reminded me. She described P2PU as a friendly place for learning and ended her message with &#8220;<strong>I love P2PU</strong>&#8221; &#8211; Reading those word stopped me in my tracks. Because there is simply nothing nicer or more important someone could say about us.</p>
<p>So, reading an article about products vs platforms today (<a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/933cc4f7df97d553ed89/24386c6a79bb4b31fb818b70b34c5eab7f12e1ff/gistfile1.txt" target="_blank">link</a>) brought a lot of this stuff together for me. If we look at P2PU as a platform, we can have all of our cakes and eat them too (something worth trying): We can have polished experiences and foster experimentation, we can build opportunities for earned income and continue to care more about community than customers, and we can be a friendly place for learning. The platform idea is not completely new (both <a href="http://twitter.com/kfasimpaur" target="_blank">Karen</a> and <a href="http://johndbritton.com/" target="_blank">John</a> deserve credit for pushing the concept of an API) but I hadn&#8217;t realized that there is a <strong>really important connection between platform and community</strong> before.</p>
<p>Here are four bold suggestions that feel in line with the spirit of Berlin 09 and provide some direction for Berlin 11. What do you think?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P2PU is a platform</strong> &#8211; There is no right product for &#8220;everyone&#8221;, the right product for everyone simply doesn&#8217;t exist. That&#8217;s particularly true for learning and that&#8217;s why shouldn&#8217;t try to build one right product, but rather build a platform that many people can turn into many right products for many different users.</li>
<li><strong>A platform with at least one great product</strong> &#8211; In order to make P2PU work as a platform, we need at least one amazing product that lots of users love. That amazing product could be one model for learning that appeals to a large group of users, or it could be a clever way for developing reputations within the community, or it could be a great way to keep track of all the cool things that are happening in P2PU &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Everyone can help build P2PU</strong> &#8211; We should encourage and support experimentation, so that the whole community can innovate (yes Dan, I&#8217;m thinking of you). We need to make sure that the UX is clean and simple, but that there is room for experimentation. Maybe we move experiments into a LAB space, but P2PU needs to be extendable, hackable, malleable &#8230;</li>
<li><strong>We eat our own dogfood</strong> &#8211; Why are we having insightful / engaged conversations on this mailing list, but very seldom on the site? We should feel frustrated by UX details that are frustrating. And we should be happy about features that are beautiful and clever.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheerio &#8211; have a great day!</p>

          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>As part of my <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/funding/fellowship-programme/" target="_blank">Shuttleworth Foundation fellowship</a>, I am asked to reflect once a year on progress I have made, and think about challenges I may have encountered (and overcome hopefully.) It always seems difficult to find the time to write these reports, but turns out to be an incredibly useful exercise in taking a longer-term view. It helps me to notice trends and developments that are easy to miss in the day-to-day excitement.</p>
<p>This is not an overview of all the things that have happened at P2PU in the last year, but rather it&#8217;s a reflection on along three broad themes: (1) building a <strong>social learning platform and community</strong>, (2) laying the groundwork, and building the partnerships necessary for <strong>hacking certification</strong>, (3) and making P2PU run like a <strong>well-oiled machine</strong>, that is fast and nimble, but remains committed to openness and transparency.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s long. You were warned. Photos thrown in for entertainment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="P2PU Plotting" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5378587781_a36928ceff.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<h2 lang="en-ZA">Building a Social Learning Platform and Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>We ran two rounds of courses, and continued to double 	the number of courses and size of our community each time (as we have done in 	every round so far). <strong>More than 3300 users signed up for 54 courses</strong> and the community has grown to 	almost 20,000 registered users by June 2011. A significant part of this growth has been driven by School of Webcraft, and together with partners we are developing a number of other schools (including schools for <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-social-innovation/" target="_blank">social innovation</a>, <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-the-mathematical-future/" target="_blank">maths education</a>, and we are currently preparing the first courses of a planned school of education / teacher training).</li>
<li>A major milestone was 	the complete <strong>re-design and migration to our <a href="http://p2pu.org" target="_blank">new web site</a></strong> which we just launched on June 17th (old site: <a href="http://archive.p2pu.org" target="_blank">archive.p2pu.org</a>). The development work was led by Zuzel Vera, our fantastic technology lead who came onboard full-time earlier this year. She rolls out updates to the site every 2 weeks, which means things are getting better all the time and we are super excited to see a small, but active open source community starting to contribute code. The idea has always been to get people who are using P2PU involved in the process of improving the platform &#8211; and we are now offering a <a href="http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-contributing-to-lernata/" target="_blank">P2PU course for 	developers</a> to help them get started (one for for UX designers is coming soon.) If you want to geek out on the technical details (Python/Django mainly) check out our <a href="https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta" target="_blank">github page</a> and development <a href="http://p2pu.lighthouseapp.com/projects/71002-lernanta/tickets" target="_blank">task tracker</a>.</li>
<li>As part of the redesign, we decided to make some <strong>adjustments to our model </strong>and<strong> added support for more flexible courses and study groups</strong>. Requiring all courses to be more or less the 	same length, and setting a coordinated start date, didn&#8217;t work for everyone. And in 	between the course cycles, there were no courses new users could sign-up 	for. That&#8217;s why the new site adds support for self-organized study 	groups that can run perpetually and encourage users to start courses 	and study groups at any point, and not confined to a small number of 	cycles each year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 lang="en-ZA">Hacking Certification</h2>
<p>One of my main 	interests has always been the idea of &#8220;hacking certification&#8221; and how we can 	recognize or certify achievements that take place in informal 	communities like P2PU.</p>
<ul>
<li>We worked hard to establish the concept of <strong>badges as part of an alternative accreditation system</strong>. P2PU co-hosted the 		“Badge Lab” (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/activities#Badge_lab" target="_blank">agenda</a>, <a href="http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/sbs/2010/11/badge-lab-at-mozilla-drumbeat/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from a participant) 		which ended up growing into one of the most influential streams of 		the event, and has since evolved into its own project, hosted by Mozilla, to create an <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/badges" target="_blank">open badges infrastructure</a>. We are also building more support around the idea of badges, by organizing a badges working group for the MacArthur Foundation (second workshop coming up).</li>
<li>Since some of these ideas are fairly new (and controversial) and I also spent a fair amount of time <strong>thinking out loud and spreading the word.</strong> Vijay Kumar invited me to speak about &#8220;hacking certification&#8221; in his &#8220;open education&#8221; course at the Harvard Extension School and I wrote a <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=692.html" target="_blank">longer blog post</a> about it afterwards (has links to recording). I presented similar ideas as part of a joint 		session on certification in open education with Sir John Daniel (ex Commonwealth of Learning) at the 		OpenCourseWare Global Conference at MIT (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/philipp/alternative-certification-8350333" target="_blank">slides at slideshare</a>), and discussed the implications of all this for the &#8220;<a href="http://bit.ly/uchri-p2pu" target="_blank">Future of the University</a>&#8221; at the University of California Humanities Research Institute. And I was recently invited to give a keynote on the topic at <a href="http://openedconference.org/2011/" target="_blank">Open Ed 2011</a>, which will take place later this year.</li>
<li>Another focus has been to build<strong> partnerships with organizations and people that have a shared interest in providing certification for open learning</strong>. We continue to work with Mozilla on badges, and the School of Webcraft. The <a href="http://ocw.uci.edu" target="_blank">University of California Irvine</a> has been a great supporter and partners since the early days, and we hope to issue professional development unites through UCI Extension very soon. And we are strengthening our relationship with MIT. <a href="http://tofp.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Steve Carson</a> from the OpenCourseWare project has been an advisor to P2PU, and Joi Ito whom I consider a mentor and who ran the <a href="http://archive.p2pu.org/general/open-journalism-open-web" target="_blank">Digital Journalism course</a> at P2PU last year recently <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/new-director/bio" target="_blank">took over as director of the MIT Media Lab</a>. Lots of opportunities there! Another great source of inspiration has come from Hal Plotkin, the senior 	policy advisor to the under-secretary of education, who has helped us think through a lot of these issues with a view on connecting them into the formal education system in the US.</li>
</ul>
<h2 lang="en-ZA">The Machine that runs P2PU</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made lots of 	progress, <strong>building an organization to support P2PU</strong>. I wrote <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2011/04/04/p2pu-the-machine/" target="_blank">this summary blog post</a> that gives a lot more detail, but in a nutshell: We incorporated as a 501(c) non profit organization in the US, and obtained our tax exempt status. We appointed a really fantastic board of directors that consists of the founders, community members, and two long term strategic partners (Cathy Casserly, Creative Commons; and Mark Surman, Mozilla). For more detail on the board see <a href="http://bit.ly/p2puboard" target="_blank">this post</a>. We are also revamping our advisory group and are specifically looking to add more business expertise and experience. And we started hiring a few great people to add to the team. P2PU is still entirely grant funded today, which is something we intend to change (see below) but we received a Hewlett grant which allows us to diversify our core funding (and we are waiting to hear back about two other large proposals.)</li>
<li>While building an organization that can accept funds and provides a legal structure is important, <strong>the open P2PU community continues to be our foundation and greatest success</strong>. We ran another great <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/11/10/p2pu-workshop-2010-we-got-barcelona-ed/" target="_blank">community 	workshop</a> in Barcelona, October 2010 to set the strategy for 2011. We are navigating how to be open and transparent to allow a wide variety of opinions and encourage participation, while at the same time being able to move fast like a start-up company (and fulfill the legal obligations of a non-profit organization). It&#8217;s a balance act, but it&#8217;s fun. For example, as we are increasing the number of paid staff, we are designing processes that involve the community &#8211; by sharing job descriptions for review and feedback, asking for nominations from the community, involving community members in the interviews, and discussing our <a href="http://pad.p2pu.org/compensation-draft" target="_blank">compensation principles</a> publicly. While we are nowhere done, we are getting better at 	keeping people in the loop, through our <a href="http://pad.p2pu.org" target="_blank">weekly community calls</a> that are open to anyone, a <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=p2pu.org_47c0loete7js50kbc38skgbhl0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Africa/Johannesburg" target="_blank">shared P2PU calendar</a>, and regular email and <a href="http://blog.p2pu.org" target="_blank">blog announcements</a> about new developments and courses.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="P2PU - We've got mad strength" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/5165639532_4dfefa0430.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s next?</span></p>
<p lang="en-ZA">This post is intended as reflection of the past, but our trajectory over the last 12 months, says something about where we are going in the next year. At least two big goals: <strong>build out certification opportunities 	for our users, and start generating revenue</strong>. We have been 	successful obtaining grants, and there continues to be donor interest in 	supporting open learning projects, but I am particularly excited to work on opportunities for revenue generation in order to make us independently sustainable in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Wednesday July 6</span></span><sup><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">th</span></span></sup><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, 2011<br />
</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">On HBS Campus:</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Cumnock 230</span></span></p>
<p>Disruptive innovation is a framework based on Clayton Christensen&#8217;s work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">disruptive technologies</a>. It is useful for analysis of surprising changes in seemingly stable industries, and why market leaders are sometimes unable to defend themselves against new entrants. It argues that the incumbents are sometimes seemingly unable to respond to new opportunities because they focus innovation on the needs of their existing customers, and that start-up competitors are well advised to move into areas that are not well served by incumbents yet (often because they are seemingly less attractive).</p>
<p>Christensen recently published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Class-Disruptive-Innovation-Change/dp/0071592067">Disrupting Class</a> (together with Michael B. Horn and Curtis W. Johnson) which applies the framework to education. I find his analysis of the problem and challenge insightful, but don&#8217;t agree with the solution suggested in his book. I find the idea of personalized education trajectories that are largely curated and mediated through technology, much less appealing (and less feasible) than an open collaborative ecosystem in which peers learn with each other, constructing their learning trajectories as they go along.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing these and other ideas with Christensen and Horn at the conference. I am not sure, but assume it&#8217;s open to the public so if you are in the area please drop by.</p>

I am interested in <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=692.html" target="_blank">hacking certification</a> &#8211; and was happy to accept <a href="http://openedconference.org/2011/" target="_blank">David&#8217;s</a> invitation to act as a <em>Strand Champion</em> for<strong> &#8220;Open credentialing, open competency certification, and open degrees&#8221;</strong> at the conference.</p>
<p>Rather than submit a more formal presentation or poster session, I thought I&#8217;d try to get some people to help me think through a fundamental question related to certification,<strong> &#8220;do we really need certification?&#8221; </strong>The format for &#8220;Testing Our Assumptions&#8221; is brilliant for these kinds of questions. And besides, traveling half-way around the world to give a presentation and <strong>speak at</strong> the smartest people in the open education space, rather than <strong>speaking with</strong> them, seems like a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Here is my proposal. Feedback welcome, and I hope to see you at the conference.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most interesting topics in the open education movement focuses on certification and credentialing of learning achievements by participants in open learning environments. The underlying assumption is that we need some form of certification, to validate what we have learned. In this session, I would like to to suggest (slightly tongue-in-cheek) that if we can re-imagine learning as a process that is authentic, social, and open &#8211; we might not require a separate certification process. Achievements can be evident in the learning itself.</p>
<p><strong>Does learning require certification?</strong></p>
<p>Certification is a signal or currency, that lets us transfer achievements to those outside of our learning community. As a student, I don&#8217;t need grades to signal my skills to those I studied with &#8211; but to those who don&#8217;t know me, my abilities, or my achievements.</p>
<p><strong>If I beat you in chess, you know that I can play</strong></p>
<p>Jim Gee calls testing &#8220;primitive&#8221; and the result of poor learning design, and compares students to game players. There is no need for testing in games, because each stage of the game requires some form of mastery and achievement before the player can enter.</p>
<p><strong>Does good learning create evidence, which can replace credentials?</strong></p>
<p>If we follow Gee, we must ask if the problem with credentials is not rooted in the design of learning environments and experience. Can we borrow lessons from game design to make learning so authentic, engaging, and social that it produces all necessary evidence of achievements as a byproduct of the learning? (Or the other way around, does the learning become a byproduct of achievements?)</p></blockquote>
<p>I should add that I am a terrible chess player &#8211; with or without a certificate.</p>

              <p>I have been interested in certification (and assessment related to certification) <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/641/1389">for a while</a>. I believe it will drive the next big step for <a href="http://p2pu.org" target="_blank">P2PU.org</a> as well as for the open education movement as a whole. Getting it right is important.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brandon Muramatsu and Vijay Kumar I&#8217;ve spent some time this week trying to make sense of the latest developments in this space. Vijay and Brandon invited me to speak to the students in their &#8220;<a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77233">Open Education Practice and Potential</a>&#8221; course at the Harvard Extension School about &#8220;Opportunities in Certification of Open Education&#8221; (slides are embedded below, and there is <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2011-04-21.1502.M.703CF92133E3519692CD66BB904BB9.vcr&amp;sid=2007009">a recording of the elluminate session</a> as well).</p>
<div id="__ss_7698284" style="width: 340px;"><object id="__sse7698284" width="340" height="284"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=p2puharvardextensionlectureapr2011-110421143537-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=p2pu-harvard-extension-lecture&amp;userName=philipp" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="340" height="284" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=p2puharvardextensionlectureapr2011-110421143537-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=p2pu-harvard-extension-lecture&amp;userName=philipp" name="__sse7698284" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>My core set of slides that I use in most presentations starts with the suggestion that &#8220;<strong>the system is broken</strong>&#8220;, which I think is true but also gets peoples&#8217; attention. I then argue that because of open educational resources the content problem is fixed, and that increasing access let&#8217;s us connect to millions of other people to learn with. Which means <strong>&#8220;now everyone can fix the broken system.</strong>&#8221; Enter <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a>. While P2PU is a good example how this is true for the learning piece of education, is it really true for the certification/credentialing? Can the open education community hack certification?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I decided to walk myself and the group through the steps of creating a certificate that has value and legitimacy, and use examples that exist today to highlight my points. What do you need to make a certificate?</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; You need a source of authority</h3>
<p>In the past, this authority came from the reputation of institutions (&#8220;Nevertheless, he&#8217;s an Oxford man.&#8221;) and an intricate system of accreditation bodies and quality review structures. It&#8217;s a system that works well for disciplines that don&#8217;t move too fast, and as long as it can reasonably be true that only a small group of &#8220;experts&#8221; really knows what&#8217;s going on. Unfortunately, and there are many reasons for this, even this old system often breaks down (&#8220;Oxford, New Mexico!&#8221;) and increasingly relies on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_gladwell">seemingly random college rankings</a> to establish authority.</p>
<p>While it has its&#8217; challenges, the existing system offers great opportunities for open education projects to move from the informal to the formal learning world &#8211; and give its users access to mainstream credentials. That&#8217;s why the <a href="http://uopeople.org" target="_blank">University of the People</a> is bravely working towards full accreditation, which will let them issue degrees that are equally recognized as other colleges in the U.S. P2PU has decided to not pursue accreditation &#8211; it felt like we&#8217;d have to give up the most interesting things about our model in order to qualify &#8211; but instead to partner with accredited institutions like the <a href="http://ocw.uci.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Irvine</a> for certification (that is backed by accreditation, just not ours).</p>
<p>But <strong><span style="color: #000000;">you don&#8217;t need an institution anymore to issue certificates.</span></strong> David Wiley (as usual, one step ahead of the curve) already did this a few years ago in his &#8220;Introduction to Open Education&#8221; course where <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/david-wiley-open-teaching-multiplies-the-benefit-but-not-the-effort/7271" target="_blank">anyone who completed the materials could request a Wiley Certificate</a>. But David Wiley is a Professor at an accredited University, so he is still part of the accredited system, right? Right! But you don&#8217;t even have to be a Professor, or have a college degree for that matter, to do the same. <a href="http://johndbritton.com" target="_blank">John D. Britton</a>, Software Evangelist at Twilio and maverick geek, credentialed participants in his P2PU course by leaving recommendations on their LinkedIn profiles. And they listed the P2PU course in their education history.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/john-testimonial.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" title="john-testimonial" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/john-testimonial.png" alt="" width="571" height="227" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe the most exciting example of new sources of authority is <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow&#8217;s Career 2.0 portal</a>. The details are worth their own blog post &#8211; but essentially Stack Overflow has found a way to surface community rankings and evaluations in a way that can replace degrees. It&#8217;s much more granular and shows the specific skills and interests a developer has, it&#8217;s transparent because it links directly to the evidence for the results, and it&#8217;s based on the opinions of thousands of fellow software developers. Stack Overflow is betting that employers get more value out of reviewing applicants on Careers 2.0 that they would get from a college degree. And I think they are right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kevin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" title="kevin" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kevin.png" alt="" width="487" height="218" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Something to show your boss, and that you can hang on your wall &#8230; your Facebook wall</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s great to have a wall full of degrees, but very few people get to see them. Wouldn&#8217;t it be more useful if we could instead share these degrees on our Facebook wall, our wordpress.com blog, our tumblr stream, and or our LinkedIn profile? And while we are busy hanging degrees, why not also share all the other achievements we might be proud of &#8211; the fact that we took a &#8220;Vegetarian Cooking&#8221; course at the Culinary Institute, that our fellow open source developers named us a &#8220;Community Builder&#8221;, or that we solved Mozilla&#8217;s &#8220;JavaScript Expert&#8221; challenge. We are entering future territory here, but this is exactly the kind of system P2PU is working on with <a href="http://mozilla.org" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> (and support of the MacArthur Foundation and friends) and piloting in the <a href="http://new.p2pu.org/en-US/schools/school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank">School of Webcraft</a>. An <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>open badges infrastructure that let&#8217;s anyone issue &#8220;badges&#8221; (that&#8217;s what we call these signs of recognition) and that let&#8217;s users move them freely around the web</strong>.

              <p>I posted an update on the administrative underbelly of P2PU over at <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2011/04/04/p2pu-the-machine/" target="_blank">http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2011/04/04/p2pu-the-machine/</a>. It covers a lot of the important (but slightly mundane) details of incorporating as a non-profit organization. While it&#8217;s annoying to fill out endless forms, many of our users are curious about how things work behind the scenes (surprisingly they work just like in front of the scenes) and it made sense to provide a big comprehensive overview of where we are and what is happening. I added some nice pictures to help readers stay awake.</p>

<p>This is a post about our plans for the <a href="http://p2pu.org/webcraft" target="_blank">Mozilla P2PU School of Webcraft</a> &#8211; a joint effort to provide web developers training and certification that is free, open, and globally accessible. At the same time this is a post about <a href="http://p2pu.org" target="_blank">P2PU</a> as a whole &#8211; which encompasses many courses on many subjects, and even a few other Schools (like <a href="http://p2pu.org/sosi" target="_blank">this</a>, and <a href="http://p2pu.org/math-future/" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h3>From prototype to product</h3>
<p>2010 was fun, experimental, and exciting. We built a cool prototype, but didn&#8217;t worry too much about the rough edges. The original School of Webcraft was designed for ourselves and our friends (the early adopters). In 2011 we will turn it into something that works for (almost) everyone interested in web development skills. We started seeking out feedback from our users, asked advice from our friends, and put together a roadmap that will help us get where we want to be by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>2011 will be focused on quality of the user experience</strong>, on designing a peer learning model and platform that can easily scale, and on tracking metrics that show we are moving in the right direction (or let us correct course easily).</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/02/webcraft-roadmap-2011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-686" title="webcraft-roadmap-2011" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2011/02/webcraft-roadmap-2011.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<h3>2011 in bullet points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone is a learner</strong> &#8211; P2P is the core learning model at School of Webcraft. However, that&#8217;s not an easy switch to make &#8211; from the traditional model where an expert teaches a group of mostly passive students &#8211; to learning with peers. At School of Webcraft everyone is a learner, and everyone is a teacher. In 2011, we will introduce more granular, smaller steps, that allow new users to &#8220;level-up&#8221; their engagement with other learners and the community. We will also nudge learners to start thinking of themselves as facilitators. Want to learn something? Run a course! We will help you.</li>
<li><strong>A new platform</strong> &#8211; Good bye Drupal you old foe. We are moving to a Python/Django solution that re-uses some of the core <a href="http://drumbeat.org" target="_blank">drumbeat.org</a> code, and adds social learning features. We already have a great community of volunteer developers (<a href="http://lists.p2pu.org/mailman/listinfo/p2pu-dev" target="_blank">list</a>, <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/213283" target="_blank">tracker</a>), who are helping with UX, cutting designs, and starting to build the basic feature set. And we are just about to hire a tech lead, who will give our efforts focus, own the technology stack, and kick us into a higher gear.</li>
<li><strong>Badges</strong> &#8211; Badges are like symbols of achievement for something you have learned. Lots of people are interested in badges as a new and alternative form of certification and we&#8217;ve driven the conversation about an open badges infrastructure, where users are in control of their credentials, and credits can be moved around more easily. We just started our badge prototype (<a href="http://erinknight.com/post/3218758524" target="_blank">background</a>), giving SoW users the opportunity to get skills badges (&#8220;javascript expert&#8221;, etc.) value badges (&#8220;accessibility&#8221; etc.) and community badges (&#8220;innovator&#8221;, &#8220;team player&#8221;, etc.). By the end of 2011 we&#8217;d like to see first anecdotal evidence that SoW badges help users get jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Growth</strong> &#8211; While our main focus for 2011 is quality, we also want to keep growing. More users means more experimentation, more feedback, more learning. We already have more than 700 users enrolled in courses (&gt; 1200 for all P2PU courses) and more than 6,000 members in the community. By the end of the year, we&#8217;d like to have at least 10,000 engaged and active peer learners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bootstrapping P2PU</h3>
<p>P2PU will always support many different and diverse learning communities. At the same time, it&#8217;s also true that School of Webcraft has always been a little special. First of all, we&#8217;ve had a great partner in the Mozilla Foundation whose values and ideas are perfectly aligned with ours. We want to see open learning succeed and we need the open web for that. Mozilla wants to preserve the open web, and needs more people who have the skills to build it &#8211; and traditional training doesn&#8217;t scale. Second, web developers understand our open peer learning model &#8211; it feels natural, because it&#8217;s what they have been doing all along. As a result SoW is growing very fast. In the current round 30 out of 54 courses are Webcraft courses, that&#8217;s more than 50%. And School of Webcraft is also getting a huge amount of attention, including some attention that might come a little too early &#8211; <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/17/learn-html5-javascript-and-css-with-mozillas-free-school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank">this mashable article</a> brought down our site. As a result School of Webcraft is the perfect opportunity to bootstrap all of P2PU.</p>

              <p><span>Erin and I are doing a whole range of things at the upcoming <a target="_blank" href="http://dmlcentral.net/conference2011">Digital Media and Learning conference</a>. Including, maybe, what they call an ignite talk. Here is our proposal (which I can&#8217;t take credit for &#8211; besides a short conversation in the back of a NY Cab). I look forward to creating some &#8220;vivid and personal imagery&#8221; &#8211; if the talk gets accepted. They also asked us if we were funny (on a scale from 1 to 5) and Erin scored us a 4 (but said we could be 5 if we wanted to).</span></p>
<p><em>In today&#8217;s world learning can look very different than traditionally imagined. Learning is not just &lsquo;seat time&rsquo; within schools, but extends across multiple contexts, experiences and interactions. It is no longer just an isolated or individual concept, but is social, informal, participatory, creative and lifelong. And yet, in the current formal education and accreditation systems, much of this learning is ignored or missed entirely. We are exploring badges as a way to support and acknowledge learning that occurs across broader connected learning ecologies so that this learning can become part of the conversation in hiring decisions, school acceptances or credits, mentoring opportunities and even self-evaluations. Badges can be used to motivate learning, signify community and signal achievement across contexts and the collection of badges can tell a more complete story of an individual. In this talk, we will present a number of user stories that demonstrate learning and interaction occurring outside of formal channels, such as an afterschool program, a local artist community, on-the-job experience and/or open education courses, and highlight the breakdown between that learning and the transference and translation across contexts, including the broader education and career ecosystems.&nbsp;Using vivid and personal imagery, we will help the audience connect with these learners and their needs, and then demonstrate how badges can enable each learner to capitalize on the learning experiences that they are already having, inspire and help them to seek out new ones and communicate their achievements and skills to necessary stakeholders.&nbsp;We also plan to take photos of attendees earning badges at the Drumbeat Science Fair on Wednesday evening, and will use those images at the end to help tie the concept and value of badges back to very real and relevant experiences that many will have just had. This talk will illustrate the conceptual framework for badges, drive home the need and potential for this alternative system and help more people get excited about working on these issues together.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p>I am at the P2PU NY Camp organized by John Britton, and in one of today&#8217;s session <a href="http://www.nighttrainconsulting.com/about">Alan Webb</a> led a brainstorm to identify additional ideas for long-term P2PU sustainability (see this <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/35267139/P2PU-Sustainability-Ideas">page</a> for our notes). And 5 minutes later this email from Beth Harris at Smarthistory (the amazing <em>multi-media web book about art and art history</em>) arrived. </p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve just launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/360446359/smarthistory-art-history-conversation">Kickstarter campaign</a> to create at least 100 new videos. This will make Smarthistory a truly viable, free alternative to the traditional and very expensive art history textbook for you, and for students around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>How are these two things related? In our sustainability conversation today kickstarter (and a related service called spot.us) came up and we were discussing about ways to integrate different aspects of P2PU with kickstarter campaigns. So, it was nice to see that others in the Open Edu space are looking at crowd funding mechanisms like kickstarter to support their efforts as well. Sustainability is a big issue for many OER and OCW projects &#8211; and getting the public involved is a great way to raise funds, and get a reality check on the services and value one provides. This approach doesn&#8217;t work for everything &#8211; some ideas are important, but more at the infrastructure level and might not appeal to a wide audience, but there are lots of things it could be used for. One idea was to help course organizers who can&#8217;t afford to run courses (and especially run courses repeatedly) raise funds through a P2PU kickstarter campaign &#8211; of which a small overhead charge would go towards supporting the core P2PU operations. There are lots of questions around paying for individual contributions in volunteer communities &#8211; and it has to be done carefully to not destabilize the intrinsic incentive mechanisms that are in place right now. But at the same time, tying some form of financial reward to individual courses would be a great gauge of value that users place in particular subjects, disciplines, or course organizers. </p>
