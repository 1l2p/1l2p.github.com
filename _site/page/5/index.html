          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>No, I am not speaking of the P2PU management and advisory boards, although some of us have taken rather unconventional academic trajectories including dropping out altogether. But I am writing about a different type of dropping out that is of great concern to P2PU: the number of people that start but don&#8217;t complete online courses, including ours.</p>
<p>When we ran our pilot, many in the P2pU community including myself were shocked to see drop out rates above 50% in most courses. We had some courses where only very few people continued to the end. Our surprise was genuine, but maybe naiv (not a bad thing I would argue). It turns out that our completion rates were no worse (or better unfortunately) than those of online education in general.</p>
<p>I quote from Berge and Huang (who reference others)</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, the percentage of students who drop out of brick and mortar higher education has held constant at between 40-45% for the past 100 years (Tinto 1982). In the online learning context, dropout rates appear to be higher than for traditional courses. While there are no national statistics for completion rates of distance education students, dropout rates are believed by some to be 10 to 20 percentage points higher than for in-person learning (Carr 2000; Diaz 2002; Frankola 2001).</p></blockquote>
<p>That means drop out rates between 50-65% are considered to be a reality in online education. Wow! (I haven&#8217;t done a comprehensive literature review, but some of the articles that are widely referenced are listed at the end of this post.)</p>
<p>I could try to make the argument that this is a success for P2pU &#8211; since our drop out rates are no worse, even though we do not offer any of the usual carrots (degrees) or sticks (fees) that keep people going usually. But unfortunately that would not be good enough. The P2PU learning model is based on a strong sense of community between peers &#8211; individuals who help each other to learn. Seeing peers drop out over time is terribly frustrating not only for the course organizer (I know, because I have spent a significant amount of time on instant messenger with course organizers who felt personally responsible and took each drop out very hard) but also for peer learners, who looser their peers.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2353/2528594807_32a83edee3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Lurking Cat" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2353/2528594807_32a83edee3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>The second argument I come across frequently when drop out rates come up, is that a high percentage of participants in online courses will only <em>lurk</em> and we shouldn&#8217;t worry about that. There is a whole book shelf of academic literature on <em>learning by lurking</em> and the <em>invisible student</em>. I am not arguing that lurkers are not learning anything, but in my personal experience and that of P2PU, it is not the lurkers that benefit most but the doers, the tinkerers and the creators &#8211; and that those are the people you will want to take a course with. It&#8217;s no fun to be in a room full of invisible students.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why P2PU is aiming for low drop out and lurking rates. Very low ones. It&#8217;s always dangerous to nail your colors to the mast, but I would go so far to say that in the perfect P2PU course, less than 10% of participants drop out or don&#8217;t participante. (Please note that this is me speaking in my personal capacity &#8211; and not necessarily the opinion of the P2PU community!)</p>
<p>I think there are many aspects of online courses that can be improved to reduce drop out rates and increase participation, but two fundamental things that enable us to shift from more than 50% leaving to something much better:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make it difficult (to join)</strong> &#8211; In our pilot phase (as well as the first round of courses we ran this year), it was too easy to sign-up for a course. As a result many people signed up because the courses &#8220;sounded interesting&#8221; without really asking themselves if they were ready to make the commitment necessary. By increasing the sign-up hurdle, we can help users think more carefully about joining a course. This hurdle should not be designed to test expertise or intellectual capacity, but motivation. If someone puts in a few hours of work to complete and submit their course sign-up form &#8211; they should be allowed to join.</li>
<li><strong>Make it personal</strong> &#8211; The interaction between participants is crucial in creating a social bond that helps people keep going when their busy lives pull them in other directions. One participant in the pilot stated that she knew one of the other participants by name (and assumed the same was true in the other direction). She said she struggled to keep up with the work, but pulled through and completed because she didn&#8217;t want her colleague to think she was a quitter. By increasing personal interaction at the beginning of the course, the social ties between participants can be strengthened. Asking participants to upload photos of themselves helps with identification &#8211; and as we feel ourselves learning more about others, we assume they learn more about ourselves &#8211; and we start caring about their opinions.</li>

          <div class="entry-content">

              <p><strong>The open web is under threat and it&#8217;s a big deal for learning and education (among other things).</strong></p>
<p>Last week a meeting on &#8220;Learning, Freedom &amp; the Web&#8221; hosted by the <a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/">Carnegie Foundation</a> brought together a mix of learning experts and web industry geeks to keep the web open for learning. One of the topics that bubbled up naturally was the rising popularity of gated digital communities such as Facebook and closed content delivery mechanisms like the iPad-iTunes-Appstore combination, and their implications for the future of open learning ecosystems.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.open-mike.org">Mike Hanson</a> from <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/">Mozilla Labs</a> sketched out what education could look like if redesigned by Steve Jobs. A vertically integrated content hosting and delivery solution built on Apple Server software and it&#8217;s iPhone, iPod and iPad line of consumer devices (of which over 100,000,000 have been sold). Textbooks are stored in the <em>iTextbook</em> store &#8211; and organized in appropriate collections for students who automatically download all the content they need to the range of IProducts. If you are an educator or administrator this new world of iEducation sounds pretty slick and compelling. And even if you are an open web activist like  Mike Hanson it is hard to resist &#8211; in fact, it was his own brand new iPad on the table that got us started on this  trajectory.</p>
<p>And because curation and integration are so compelling when designed well, we need to carefully think through the implications now. If a personal computing experience built on open standards is the crib, then learning and freedom might be about to go out the window.</p>
<p>As we know already there won&#8217;t be any porn in Steve Jobs iEducation ecosystem, but there also won&#8217;t be much messiness and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqDq_Q9iKvo">tinkering</a> and the kind of practices that characterize constructivist learning processes. There is value in a curated and integrated entertainment experience &#8211; I myself have marveled at the ease of purchasing and downloading a digital album directly onto my phone and then syncing it into a music library stored on my computer. However, I am a music consumer &#8211; and in meaningful learning systems there are designers, builders, players and doers &#8211; but no consumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8001743360324019114#">Connie Yowell</a> from the MacArthur Foundation made the connection back to the education system. Half thinking-out-loud, half predicting the trouble to come she suggested that the vertically integrated learning ecology that devices like the iPad enable are perfectly in line with the way the current education system is structured &#8211; and will therefore be happily embraced by it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we need to understand the long-term implications, push the closed model to at least offer open interfaces and transparency, and put in place open alternatives that offer value in ways that closed approaches can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What could have turned into a pretty gloomy afternoon, was saved by the same innovation process that the open web is so good at: identify the pieces that are in place, see how they can be connected, and start designing and building. We came up with 8 concrete project ideas that are made possible by combining an open source attitude with a deep passion and concern for equitable learning.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t list them all here, but there are a few that are most relevant to P2PU and which we volunteered to play a part in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/project/p2p-university-open-web-career-track">P2PU School of Webcraft</a></strong> &#8211; our partnership with Mozilla to radically innovate how web developers get trained and find jobs &#8211; fits within a broader bucket for linking community assessment, badges (think boy scouts), and employment opportunities. It raises questions about ownership and control of the individual&#8217;s education data &#8211; the obvious answer coming from the open web community is that it should be the individual who is in charge of her learning data, but the reality today is that lots of different pieces are stuck in different institutions. Thinking beyond web developers, we&#8217;d like to find a few other areas where this would work.</li>
<li><strong>Does open increase equity? </strong>- <a href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/">Mimi Ito</a> reminded us that for open learning to become more than just another opportunity entrenching inequality in education, it needs to increase equity and access. She suggested we needed empirical research to identify areas within the closed certification system that are truly broken and investigate how new open approaches like the one described above could help fix them. I believe web development is one such area, where employers find that existing university degrees or private training certification have little to say about an applicant&#8217;s abilities as a web developer &#8211; the truly relevant things are not assessed &#8211; but Mimi is right that we need more robust research to go from anecdotal evidence to validation of these claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other projects included formal university courses where students engage with Wikipedia content, a look at opportunities around Google Apps (which raises interesting questions about which aspects of an open ecosystem need to be open), and concrete ideas for working with particular programs and partners, for example Road Trip Nation.</p>
<p>The small event at Carnegie was just the beginning of new collaborations between the open web world and learning. Those projects that can demonstrate they are moving forward will meet again to plan the next stage of implementation in September, and hopefully have first prototypes to share with the world in November &#8211; where the Mozilla Drumbeat festival in Barcelona offers an opportunity to showcase our work, and reach out to more collaborators.</p>

          <h3 class="entry-title"><a href="../../index.html%3Fp=633.html" rel="bookmark">Paying for infrastructure &#8211; Creative Commons Catalyst</a></h3>
          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>Today Creative Commons launches their catalyst campaign &#8211; brother to the recently announced <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants" target="_blank">catalyst grant</a> programme. I like how they connect the two &#8211; funding their work AND raising money at the same time. On one hand, they offer small grants for projects that further their vision, and with the other hand they politely ask for donations to support it. It creates a connection between the donation and the purpose of that donation, even if it&#8217;s a very loose connection.</p>
<blockquote><p>Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organizations to harness the power of Creative Commons. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could support a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licenses to create a new class of socially responsible businesses. Anyone may apply for a Catalyst Grant, which ranges from $1,000-$10,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">But we can&#8217;t do it without your help.</a> Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the grants that will make all this possible. Donate today to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across all cultural and national boundaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>CC&#8217;s work is a very important foundation of a lot of the open content / commons movement &#8211; and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s easy to raise the funds necessary to support it. Hal Plotkin asked this question after his keynote at the recent OCWC Global conference. How should and can something that provides an important, but not very glamorous (my words, not Hal&#8217;s, with apologies to my lawyer friends at CC) enabling service be supported financially? Funding for infrastructure is difficult to raise. It&#8217;s a little bit like raising money for TCP/IP or HTTP. Everyone will agree that it&#8217;s important and we all benefit from having it &#8211; but we all hope that someone else will pick up the tab. We rely on that friend of a friend who got rich on stock options, sold his company, or house &#8211; or simply inherited a lot of money.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a social democracy that offers high-quality infrastructure and services to (almost) all of its citizens, my immediate response is that infrastructure should be paid for by the state from tax income. I personally would welcome a small part of my tax payments to be used to support important infrastructure projects that enable free flow of knowledge and information. Even more so, now that I live in a country where access to knowledge is scarce and expensive. I believe such would be an excellent investment in future development and well-being of all citizens.</p>
<p>The problem with writing blog posts about topics like this is &#8211; you end up getting stuck in a dilemma. I have now explained that I think CC&#8217;s work is important, that I suspect many people fail to support it, and that the government should consider doing so. However, pending major adjustments in the political landscape of South Africa, that doesn&#8217;t really help anyone. So I went ahead and donated a little money to CC today.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/support/2010/cc-support.png" border="0" alt="Support CC" /></a></p>
<p>The benefit of donating is the perceived authority to ramble on a little bit longer, and say a few things about what CC are doing what I think could be improved. In order to do that I think its worth looking at the licences as a service (or even a product) that has to be sold to a particular audience and designing it in order to provide maximum value to that audience. What I mean by that is that there is a tendency for organizations to turn inwards &#8211; and in the case of CC that means pay more and more attention to the opinions of legal experts &#8211; rather than listen to the customers who don&#8217;t understand the legal details, and in most cases don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s hat. Here is what I&#8217;d like to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to see fewer licences and fewer versions &#8211; but more certainty that the licence will hold up in court. I believe simplicity beats choice and legal finesse.</li>
<li>I would like to see CC separate its core business (the licences) more clearly from other programme areas and especially things that fall broadly into the fostering of &#8220;creativity (cultural, educational, scientific and other content) in the commons&#8221;. This separation should include budgets &#8211; so that donors can choose what activities their money ends up supporting. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think creativity should be supported, and probably in a fairly vague and flexible way, but I think part of the funding challenge for CC is that people, especially those who are making small donations, are comfortable funding the licences but might not be as comfortable with CC using their donation to foster &#8220;creativity&#8221;. That applies to me for example.</li>

              <p>Ethan Zuckerman recently wondered if it was &#8220;<a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2010/05/13/global-voices-love-and-money/" target="_blank">love or money</a>&#8221; that drives amazing volunteer communities like the one over at <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/" target="_blank">global voices</a>. Now, we are small fry compared to GV at the moment, but it&#8217;s a question that is becoming relevant to <a href="http://p2pu.org" target="_blank">P2PU</a> too as we continue to grow and expand globally. As I am sure you know it&#8217;s all <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou5pzKuKP8w" target="_blank">one love</a> at P2PU, but some of us also need to eat (and one or two people &#8211; including me &#8211; even sleep occasionally).</p>
<p>There are a few problems with money. One is that (at least it seems that) there is no way to pay everyone in open source projects. If Wikipedia had worked out a complicated payment mechanism for all contributions, it would most likely not have grown into the amazingly vast knowledge repository it is. Two, while it is very well possible to get paid while doing things for love, money also makes people to do things they don&#8217;t love. And we want everyone involved in p2pu to be in it for the love. However, not having money in the volunteer community also creates problems &#8211; the main one is that it keeps out those people who simply can&#8217;t afford to work for free, and often those are the ones that represent the majority of people on this planet. Pretending that everyone has the same freedom to volunteer is not just wrong, but also a strategic mistake for a global project like P2PU. So, let me wonder out loud how a volunteer community driven by love could avoid starving:</p>
<p><strong>Idea 1 &#8211; A big pile of gold</strong>. What if we had a &#8220;pile&#8221; of let&#8217;s say 10,000 USD and every gang-star (gang-stars are volunteers with a long history and commitment in P2PU, think of them like module owners or similar positions in open source projects) could charge a certain hourly rate against this pile for project relevant activities that they could define relatively freely. People would simply report hours and achievements online and at the end of each month we tally up and pay out. I really have no idea if this could work &#8211; and can think of lots of potential problems (conflict between those who charge and those who work for free? who gets to say that someone is charging too much?).</p>
<p><strong>Idea 2 &#8211; Check the list</strong>. An alternative would be to outline specific projects that we need done and earmark budget for them &#8211; and gang-stars can decide to take them on. that might be a little more structured and comprehensible &#8211; and maybe with less potential to lead to conflict?</p>
<p><strong>Idea 3 &#8211; Make our own money.</strong> Or we could work with an imaginary currency (mullahs) and people accrue mullah&#8217;s for work they do. each month they can decide to trade mullahs for real money (1 mullah = 1 USD) or horde them for things like participation in the community meeting (1000 mullahs?).</p>
<p>If you know how to make money from love (as in alchemy, not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2Qad-gaHMg" target="_blank">roxanne</a>) let us know and share the magic.</p>

          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>As part of my new do-it-right-away-if-it-takes-only-a-minute-or-five strategy, here is a short quote from Glyn Moody&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/How-to-Become-Linus-Torvalds-999542.html">how to become Linus Torvalds</a>. It&#8217;s a concise description of the kind of leadership I would love to see engrained in the way P2PU grows up. Especially the highlighted (my highlight, not Glyn&#8217;s) sentence is worth repeating repeating repeating repeating &#8230; a few hundred times as part of the morning chant. Ronald Heifetz, whose book on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6638.Leadership_Without_Easy_Answers">Leadership</a> I am (still) reading speaks of the same spirit of leadership that is grounded in authority conferred by the community.</p>
<blockquote><p>Linus has developed what amounts to a new way of managing large-scale projects involving huge numbers of geographically-dispersed contributors. Although the final decisions rest with him, he takes them in consultation with a wide range of coders. He is constantly involved in discussions on key mailing lists that allow important issues to be raised by anyone. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ultimately, then, he leads in part by being able to sense what the collective will of the Linux development community is on particular issues, and by not straying too far from it.</span></p>
<p>Now, there is only one Linus, but I believe that general approach is starting to move out into other spheres. In part, that&#8217;s because adaptations of the open source development methodology – based on a modular, distributed, collaborative development model – are being applied in more and more fields, from content to science and even to government. That approach brings with it a need for a different kind of management: top-down just doesn&#8217;t work in these circumstances. And so, as well as the novel business model that free software implies, discussed in my <a href="http://sharing-nicely.net/open/features/Why-Making-Money-from-Free-Software-Matters-985505.html">last column</a>, it has also engendered a radically new way of running things.</p></blockquote>

              <p>I was happy to see <a href="http://www.mura.org/" target="_blank">Brandon Muramatsu</a> at the OCWC Vietnam meeting and get some time to hang out, check out the latest gadges (geek!) and go to his presentation. He asked the audience &#8211; &#8220;what would you like to be able to do with MIT OCW?&#8221; Turns out he and <a href="http://mit.edu/vkumar/www/" target="_blank">Vijay Kumar</a> (who is on the <a href="http://p2pu.org/advisors" target="_blank">P2PU advisory group</a>) are plotting something called <a href="http://greenfield.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Greenfield</a> that would bolt a few useful services onto a copy of the MIT OCW archive. Very exciting for P2PU and I tracked him down after his presentation for a short chat about the project.</p>
<p>He was nice enough to offer his digital camera to record &#8211; and, voila, video blog number 2. As I am trying to better understand the value of video (thanks <a href="http://bokaap.net/open-edu/thoughts-on-disrupting-class-and-leadership-without-easy-answers/#comments">Stian and John for comments</a>) this conversation approach definitely makes a lot more sense to me.</p>

          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>At this point, I find the work on open accreditation to be the most innovative part of the open education space. It&#8217;s not just exiting because it cuts at the heart of how the education system supposedly validates learning, but also because it prompts us to ask big questions about the reasons for studying and learning, the performance of institutional structures that are in charge of measuring quality, and the possibilities of competition from both the private and non-profit sectors. In the context of P2PU, I am specifically hoping that there are opportunities to generate income from open accreditation services in ways that would help us achieve long term sustainability, but not jeopardize our full commitment to be free and open.</p>
<p>I was talking to the other P2PU founders last night and realized that while in my head, the open accreditation work at P2PU all fits together nicely, I hadn&#8217;t articulated well how all the different pieces together make a pie. This <a href="http://bokaap.net/bits-and-pieces/alternative-accreditation/">earlier post</a> has a summary of early thinking on open accreditation. But we have added a number of things to our original plans since then:</p>
<ul>
<li>The P2PU/Mozilla Open Web project is taking off. The idea is to create an alternative career path for people who want to become web developers or designers: curriculum with the latest open web technologies, assessment that looks no just at technical skills, but also employment relevant soft skills, and a trusted certification with the P2PU/Mozilla brand. We have a <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/project/p2p-university-open-web-career-track">drumbeat page</a> to reach out to the community and <a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/">John Britton</a>, who is running the first open web course at P2PU, was contracted by Mozilla to coordinate the curriculum development part. <a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/">Mark Surman</a> and I started talking to more people at SXSW recently to pull them into the curriculum conversations. The idea is to form a larger community of experts who can help us identify the core skills needed by web developers, and design a set of courses that build those skills. If you are one of them or have recommendations, leave a comment here or sign up on the <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/project/p2p-university-open-web-career-track">drumbeat page</a>.</li>
<li>The piece that had been missing in the P2PU Open Web project was assessment of soft skills, some call them &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology)">habitus</a>&#8216; or &#8216;<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2008/02/the_gamer_disposition.html">disposition</a>&#8216; &#8212; it&#8217;s things like an attitude towards problem solving, leadership skills, the ability to communicate well with users and clients, and a sense of curiosity that makes some developers stand out. When we speak to employers, they rarely mention technical skills, those are assumed to exist. Employers want to see &#8220;work that was done&#8221; and have an interesting conversation about that work with the applicant. They also want to make sure that new employees fit into the culture and are able to work well with the existing team. A university degree has low predictive power in these areas. At the <a href="http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/?c=enJLKQNlFiG&amp;b=2029199">Mac Arthur Foundation</a> grantees meeting, I spoke to <a href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/">Mimi Ito</a> about our interest in assessing these skills, and she introduce me to a number of fantastic people in her network who are doing work on assessment. Together with <a href="http://www.ssrc.org/staff/erickson-ingrid/">Ingrid Erickson</a> (based at the SSRC and involved in a range of Mac Arthur projects) we hope to bring together the different communities (assessment researchers, open web developers, curriculum designers, P2PU, Mozilla, outreach partners) for a small workshop some time in May. The goal is to design a few meaningful assessment models that we can then implement (aka write software and design processes to support) and pilot for the web developer courses.</li>
<li>Our bigger workshop, provisionally planned for September at this point and supported by funds from my Shuttleworth Foundation fellowship, will then allow us to step back and review what we have done in the P2PU/Mozilla Open Web project, look at other ways for assessment and certification, including community reputations, and develop a more strategic approach on open accreditation for P2PU. We are thinking of ways to reach out to the broader research community to get a better idea of the scope of work that is already happening. I expect that we will find interesting things in areas not typically associated with learning and ranging from collaborative filtering, and community reputations to semi-automated text analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we are biting off a bigger open accreditation piece than originally intended. And in order to pull all those pieces together we are planning to bring on a part-time consultant shortly.</p>

          <!-- <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">P</span></h4> -->
          
          <div class="entry-content">

              <p>After 3 months of hacking Jetpacks, debugging code, refining user experiences, and having a good ol&#8217; time with teams from all over the world, the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning">Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge</a> is sadly coming to an end. In the same spirit of sharing and collaboration that has made this project so much fun, we couldn&#8217;t decide on just one overall winner, and decided three projects should get a special prize.</p>
<p><strong>And the winners are &#8230; </strong></p>
<p>Really, all ten projects that were at the Austin Design Camp, are Design Challenge winners, but three get a special mention. The three stood out for different reasons and we wanted to highlight this diversity in excellence. Expression Widgets got the prize for &#8220;best open web hack&#8221;. ClozeFox was selected as &#8220;best use case&#8221; and Laurian Gridinoc from the Mupple project deserves the prize for &#8220;sharing knowledge with others&#8221;.</p>
<p>Expression Widgets has awesome features for annotating the open web and stores notes in any open wiki page. ClozeFox turns any webpage into a language learning opportunity. It&#8217;s well integrated with social networking features and provides a compelling use case. Throughout the Design Challenge, Laurian Gridinoc from the Mupple project helped to fix bugs, answered questions, and was always interested in figuring out how to solve coding problems &#8211; not just for his own project. The fact that he managed to build an awesome Jetpack on top of that makes his community contribution prize even more remarkable.  The official announcement, with a description of each projects is below.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the three projects and all ten winners who were at the Design Camp!</p>
<p><strong>So, what now? Good bye Design Challenge, Viva Jetpack for Learning!</strong></p>
<p>Just because the Design Challenge ends, doesn&#8217;t mean the fun stops. As a group, we spent the last afternoon of the Design Camp plotting ideas for the future, how we run more courses for more people, how we bring new faces into this community, and how we stay in touch as a small community of practice. The fact that there is a larger Mozilla community to hook into plays an important role in this. Aza Raskin from Mozilla Labs stopped by to explain the Jetpack Ambassador programme, which sparked some lively discussions and a lot of interest to get involved. And the Mozilla/P2PU Drumbeat project for hacking open web developer accreditation might provide an avenue for further course about add-on and Jetpack development.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT </span></p>
<p>Mozilla &#8220;Jetpack for Learning&#8221; Design Challenge announces winners at SXSW</p>
<p>Three projects of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning">Jetpack for Learning Design Challeng</a>e were awarded special prizes at the Mozilla SXSW party today. Ten projects already selected as Design Challenge winners participated in a design camp in Austin, TX over the past three days. Today three of these projects were chosen for special awards: Expression Widgets was chosen as the &#8220;best web hack&#8221;. ClozeFox was selected as &#8220;best use case&#8221; and the project leader of Mupple received the prize for &#8220;sharing knowledge with others&#8221;. You can find more information about them and download all Jetpacks from the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning">Design Challenge wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge supported projects that turn the open web into a rich social learning environment. Developed by <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/">Mozilla Labs</a>, a design challenge is an innovative combination of online seminar series, programming competition and hands-on workshop. Jetpacks enable anyone who knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build powerful Firefox add-ons. Jetpack for Learning is a part of Mozilla&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/">Drumbeat</a> initiative and was supported by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation <a href="http://digitallearning.macfound.org">Digital Media and Learning program</a>. The Design Camp was facilitated by <a href="http://www.aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Project teams from across the world started working on Jetpack prototypes in December 2009. After the first round of seminars, ten finalists were invited to attend Design Camp, a hands-on workshop for hacking Jetpacks and the future of open education, which took place just before SXSW. The overall winners were selected by a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning/Criteria">panel of judges</a> and the Design Challenge participants themselves.</p>
<p>The Design Challenge finalists showcase different ways of learning on the open web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clozefox &#8211; Clozefox turns any webpage into an interactive, educational and fun language learning resource, and share your progress on twitter.</li>
<li>Cohere &#8211; Collaboratively annotate the web with Cohere. Create semantic connections between annotations while discussing them with other users online.</li>
<li>ExpressionWidgets &#8211; Create, capture and share web content like text and images collaboratively with Expression Widgets.</li>
<li>HooverNotes &#8211; Annotate the web like a book with HooverNotes. Leave comments, highlight content and collect pieces of content from multiple sites or a single web page.</li>
<li>LangLadder &#8211; Learn a new language while doing your everyday internet activities. Langladder integrates language exercises into activities like email, social networking and blogs.</li>
<li>LineHive.com &#8211; Hyperlink storytelling. Create paths through the internet by grouping webpages and sites into a timeline you can share, tweet, or embed.</li>
<li>Mupple &#8211; Keep best practices and experiences with Mupple by recording your web activity and sharing them with others on the web.</li>
<li>Net Detective &#8211; Joe Denton is one of the best gumshoes on the force, but he can&#8217;t solve these cases without your Internet detective skills in this jetpack that turns Internet search skills into a game for kids.</li>
<li>Rubrick &#8211; Create, share and reuse teaching rubrics using Rubrick and allow both teachers and students to get on the same page.</li>
<li>Study Troll &#8211; Be sure you know your facts before the Study Troll comes and demands an answer in this jetpack that turns any web session into an interactive flash card quiz.</li>
</ul>
