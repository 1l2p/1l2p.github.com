		<description><![CDATA[Hey Michael: 

We ended up running a workshop at the Carnegie Foundation, and two small workshops on badges. One outcome is the open badge infrastructure initiative that is funded by MacArthur and hosted at Mozilla. More info at &lt;a href=&quot;http://openbadges.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://openbadges.org&lt;/a&gt;.

With respect to assessment of soft skills we are currently writing a white paper on assessment for the web, which will touch on the difficulties and why social learning online offers opportunities that don&#039;t exist in formal campus-based education. Should be ready to share in the next few weeks. 

We also realized that building assessments wasn&#039;t enough and that we had to look at both the learning model and the assessment together. The result of that work is coming together in the form of learning challenges. They have collaboration and peer-review built into the content, which makes it much easier to track learners&#039; performance. Not 100% ready, but have a look at our notepad with links to existing resources:
