				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot of noise about badges at the moment with opinions ranging from &#8220;we don&#8217;t need no stinkin&#8217; badges&#8221; to &#8220;badges will lead to global peace.&#8221; I have been one of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/b/b1/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_092011.pdf" target="_blank">original instigators</a> (PDF) of the badges for learning movement (is it really a movement?), but my favorite session at the recent DML conference was <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cts=1331162548829&amp;ved=0CDkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.media.mit.edu%2F~mres&amp;ei=su1XT9f2AejC2wXgt8TpDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbqLQCeKDub06Gvkl7K06v07FQeA" target="_blank">Mitch</a> Resnick&#8217;s panel &#8220;<a href="http://dml2012.dmlcentral.net/content/dml-are-badges-answer-perspectives-motivation-lifelong-learning" target="_blank">Are badges the answer</a>&#8221; which looked at the wide range of factors that motivate learning and discussed possible negative effects that badges could have on motivation.</p>
<p>Here is my nutshell summary of the panel:</p>
<blockquote><p>Research suggests that introducing an extrinsic reward (in the form of a badge) will decrease existing intrinsic motivation. We also know and understand that many other factors can provide intrinsic motivation for learning. In order to avoid lowering participants&#8217; desire to learn, we should therefor focus on understanding and increasing the development of the intrinsic motivation and refrain from introducing extrinsic rewards.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am glad to see people like Mitch and his panelists add their thoughtful voices to the conversation. He is right that there is a risk that we get badges wrong. And he is right that the hype around badges may lead to the development of poorly designed badge systems that will at best not improve learning, and at worst hinder it.</p>
<p>But I believe that there is more to badges than their role in motivating learning. And that through careful design choices we can try to avoid the negative impacts he describes. After all that&#8217;s what his team at Scratch is already doing &#8211; experimenting with aspects of rewards that are not that different from badges, such as showing points for discussion forum participation and counting remixes.</p>
<p><strong>The issue is not, &#8220;badges or no badges&#8221; The issue is how we can design badge systems that foster great learning practices.</strong> We will learn a lot more about how these systems work in the next year as the <a href="http://www.dmlcompetition.net/Competition/3/winners.php?comp=ll" target="_blank">DML badge competition projects</a> kick into implementation, but for now I would suggest two simple design principles to get us started in the right direction:</p>
<p><strong>1 &#8211; Use badges to define roles rather than as rewards.</strong> In many learning communities users take different roles. Mitch actually mentions the importance of taking roles within a community like Scratch, but he sees roles as separate from badges. I believe that by recognizing roles &#8211; for example a mentor role &#8211; through a badge will signal to a new members of the community that mentorship is a valued practice within the community, and helps  them identify those who can help with problems and questions. And finally it may encourage users to strive to become mentors themselves. So rather than give badges as rewards they can help diffuse awareness of roles within a community.</p>
<p><strong>2 &#8211; Anchor badges within community.</strong> The relationship between issuer and recipients will influence perceptions and expectations around badges. Badges that are woven into the fabric of a community of learning will be perceived less as extrinsic motivators, but as representation of core practices within the community. When the badge recipient feels ownership of the design of the badge, because she fully considers herself a member of the community that defines and issues the badge, the badge can provide an effective marker of learning pathways that help the learner to orientate herself within the landscape, and can act as a marker and pointer for new members of the community following in her steps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worth checking out Matthew Ladner&#8217;s guest post on <a href="http://jaypgreene.com/2012/02/15/the-desperate-need-for-market-forces-in-education/" target="_blank">Jay Greene&#8217;s blog</a> in which he argues that we need to create more space within the education system for market forces to bring down cost and increase quality.</p>
<p>It lists some of the pro-business (e.g. more private &amp; less public, let the market solve our problems) arguments and those of us who don&#8217;t agree (including me) need to be prepared to argue the other side. The post also has a good thread of comments that cover some of the shortcomings of the pro-market positions (see one example below). I would add that other countries with strong public education systems (Northern Europe for example) do not exhibit similar cost increase in education. And the US health care system, which is highly market driven, is running up costs even faster than education. Both points suggest that this is not an economics problem, it&#8217;s a US problem.</p>
<p>OER is in an interesting space in this debate. I have seen &#8220;open&#8221; come under attack from both sides -&gt; one side called it a right-wing effort to undermine the public education system by letting non-experts participate, others label it a socialist conspiracy that is out to destroy the publishing business.</p>
<p><strong>You know you&#8217;re doing <em>something</em> right when you irritate all of the incumbents.</strong></p>
<p>Example comments:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">George Mitchell says:</span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Parry says &#8216;I think the whole premise of this post is disingenuous. If it were the “public” in public education that was holding back this imagined productivity growth curve, one would expect to see private schools figuring out how to make the productivity happen.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Wow. Where to begin? In Milwaukee, independent research documents that private schools do as well or better with low-income students, and those students graduate at higher rates, than their peers in public schools. Yet private schools operate at a fraction — I estimate 2/3 — of the cost of public schools. Those are clear productivity gains that would soar if there were a true open market.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reply &gt;&gt; michael mazenko says</span></p>
<p>George, the private school market has numerous advantages in cost – the primary one being they have no responsibility to provide additional, extremely costly services under the Americans with Disabilities Act. They have a right of refusal on their applicant base, and are dealing with no consumers who did not choose them. They don’t have to compete with Title IX requirements, nor do they have the same security concerns. The tit-for-tat cost between public private is a gross overgeneralization.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/10/harvard-initiative-learning-teaching-gustave-rita-hauser-gift" target="_blank">announcement</a> about Harvard receiving a US$ 40M gift to support teaching and learning innovation made me think more about the platform conversation we&#8217;ve been having (<a href="http://sharing-nicely.net/2011/10/platform/" target="_blank">here</a> and on the mailing list). Besides giving an elite university a lot of cash, <strong>how can we foster more innovation in learning and teaching in ways that will affect more people?</strong></p>
<p>It struck me that there isn&#8217;t really an <strong>open lab for learning innovation</strong> &#8211; and that P2PU could be it. During Monday night&#8217;s board meeting we discussed sustainability, and Neeru riffed on the platform idea a bit. She wondered if we could model ourselves as a research institute. There would be heaps of experimentation and research, some of it driven by us and some driven by partners who want to work with us, and each year we would publish a string of short reports about what we are learning. Cathy added that we could connect it to an annual conference with great speakers from the P2PU community who share the results of their work, and suggested that corporations would be willing to pay substantive amounts of money for this knowledge.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the term &#8220;lab&#8221;. Speaking to more people about the idea of a &#8220;platform&#8221; made me realize that it&#8217;s a term that means different things to different people. And when I explained that it was a mechanism to support experimentation and research, they would ask if it was &#8220;kind of like a lab.&#8221; And that&#8217;s exactly what it would it be like.</p>
<p>The idea of an open lab for social learning sounds exciting and it feels in line with our original spirit of experimentation. What would it look like?</p>
<p><strong>Supported by a platform that is extendable, hackable, malleable and customizable</strong> &#8211; We need a sandbox, so that we have a place to experiment, and track the results of these experiments. But the sandbox is not the important piece here, it&#8217;s a means to an end (or a journey rather).</p>
<p><strong>Run by a community that is passionate about peer learning and openness, and thrives on experimentation</strong> &#8211; In her <a href="http://sharing-nicely.net/2011/10/platform/#comments" target="_blank">comment</a> earlier, <a href="http://twitter.com/kfasimpaur" target="_blank">Karen</a> pointed out that talking about &#8220;platform&#8221; wasn&#8217;t enough and asked &#8220;how do content, community, and methods tie into this?&#8221; She is absolutely right. What happens on the platform is directly connected to the values and principles we hold as a community. I think we need to spend more time talking about what they mean to us &#8211; but our three original values of open, community, and peer-learning have stood the test of time quite well so far.</p>
<p><strong>Turning experiments into great learning experiences for lots of people</strong> - This third bullet is new and still a bit wonky (and needs word-smithing). But it&#8217;s an important stake to put in the ground if we want to make sure our work has a broader benefit. Many research labs have to rely on industry to turn their work into products and services that affect &#8220;normal&#8221; people. As a result success is often measured through proxies for innovation (like scientific articles, or patents, etc.) because the research work is at least one layer removed from the &#8220;end-user&#8221;. Luckily that&#8217;s not the case for us, because the end-user is part of the P2PU community. Why not be bold and try to measure impact through our ability to turn experimentation into great social learning experiences that work for many people?</p>
<p>While Harvard can focus on innovating teaching and learning within the institution &#8211; we could be the open learning lab for everyone. Thoughts?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been interested in certification (and assessment related to certification) <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/641/1389">for a while</a>. I believe it will drive the next big step for <a href="http://p2pu.org" target="_blank">P2PU.org</a> as well as for the open education movement as a whole. Getting it right is important.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brandon Muramatsu and Vijay Kumar I&#8217;ve spent some time this week trying to make sense of the latest developments in this space. Vijay and Brandon invited me to speak to the students in their &#8220;<a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77233">Open Education Practice and Potential</a>&#8221; course at the Harvard Extension School about &#8220;Opportunities in Certification of Open Education&#8221; (slides are embedded below, and there is <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2011-04-21.1502.M.703CF92133E3519692CD66BB904BB9.vcr&amp;sid=2007009">a recording of the elluminate session</a> as well).</p>
<div id="__ss_7698284" style="width: 340px;"><object id="__sse7698284" width="340" height="284"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=p2puharvardextensionlectureapr2011-110421143537-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=p2pu-harvard-extension-lecture&amp;userName=philipp" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="340" height="284" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=p2puharvardextensionlectureapr2011-110421143537-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=p2pu-harvard-extension-lecture&amp;userName=philipp" name="__sse7698284" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>My core set of slides that I use in most presentations starts with the suggestion that &#8220;<strong>the system is broken</strong>&#8220;, which I think is true but also gets peoples&#8217; attention. I then argue that because of open educational resources the content problem is fixed, and that increasing access let&#8217;s us connect to millions of other people to learn with. Which means <strong>&#8220;now everyone can fix the broken system.</strong>&#8221; Enter <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a>. While P2PU is a good example how this is true for the learning piece of education, is it really true for the certification/credentialing? Can the open education community hack certification?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I decided to walk myself and the group through the steps of creating a certificate that has value and legitimacy, and use examples that exist today to highlight my points. What do you need to make a certificate?</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; You need a source of authority</h3>
<p>In the past, this authority came from the reputation of institutions (&#8220;Nevertheless, he&#8217;s an Oxford man.&#8221;) and an intricate system of accreditation bodies and quality review structures. It&#8217;s a system that works well for disciplines that don&#8217;t move too fast, and as long as it can reasonably be true that only a small group of &#8220;experts&#8221; really knows what&#8217;s going on. Unfortunately, and there are many reasons for this, even this old system often breaks down (&#8220;Oxford, New Mexico!&#8221;) and increasingly relies on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_gladwell">seemingly random college rankings</a> to establish authority.</p>
<p>While it has its&#8217; challenges, the existing system offers great opportunities for open education projects to move from the informal to the formal learning world &#8211; and give its users access to mainstream credentials. That&#8217;s why the <a href="http://uopeople.org" target="_blank">University of the People</a> is bravely working towards full accreditation, which will let them issue degrees that are equally recognized as other colleges in the U.S. P2PU has decided to not pursue accreditation &#8211; it felt like we&#8217;d have to give up the most interesting things about our model in order to qualify &#8211; but instead to partner with accredited institutions like the <a href="http://ocw.uci.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Irvine</a> for certification (that is backed by accreditation, just not ours).</p>
<p>But <strong><span style="color: #000000;">you don&#8217;t need an institution anymore to issue certificates.</span></strong> David Wiley (as usual, one step ahead of the curve) already did this a few years ago in his &#8220;Introduction to Open Education&#8221; course where <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/david-wiley-open-teaching-multiplies-the-benefit-but-not-the-effort/7271" target="_blank">anyone who completed the materials could request a Wiley Certificate</a>. But David Wiley is a Professor at an accredited University, so he is still part of the accredited system, right? Right! But you don&#8217;t even have to be a Professor, or have a college degree for that matter, to do the same. <a href="http://johndbritton.com" target="_blank">John D. Britton</a>, Software Evangelist at Twilio and maverick geek, credentialed participants in his P2PU course by leaving recommendations on their LinkedIn profiles. And they listed the P2PU course in their education history.</p>
<p><a href="http://sharing-nicely.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/john-testimonial.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" title="john-testimonial" src="http://sharing-nicely.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/john-testimonial.png" alt="" width="571" height="227" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe the most exciting example of new sources of authority is <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow&#8217;s Career 2.0 portal</a>. The details are worth their own blog post &#8211; but essentially Stack Overflow has found a way to surface community rankings and evaluations in a way that can replace degrees. It&#8217;s much more granular and shows the specific skills and interests a developer has, it&#8217;s transparent because it links directly to the evidence for the results, and it&#8217;s based on the opinions of thousands of fellow software developers. Stack Overflow is betting that employers get more value out of reviewing applicants on Careers 2.0 that they would get from a college degree. And I think they are right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sharing-nicely.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kevin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" title="kevin" src="http://sharing-nicely.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kevin.png" alt="" width="487" height="218" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Something to show your boss, and that you can hang on your wall &#8230; your Facebook wall</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s great to have a wall full of degrees, but very few people get to see them. Wouldn&#8217;t it be more useful if we could instead share these degrees on our Facebook wall, our wordpress.com blog, our tumblr stream, and or our LinkedIn profile? And while we are busy hanging degrees, why not also share all the other achievements we might be proud of &#8211; the fact that we took a &#8220;Vegetarian Cooking&#8221; course at the Culinary Institute, that our fellow open source developers named us a &#8220;Community Builder&#8221;, or that we solved Mozilla&#8217;s &#8220;JavaScript Expert&#8221; challenge. We are entering future territory here, but this is exactly the kind of system P2PU is working on with <a href="http://mozilla.org" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> (and support of the MacArthur Foundation and friends) and piloting in the <a href="http://new.p2pu.org/en-US/schools/school-of-webcraft/" target="_blank">School of Webcraft</a>. An <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>open badges infrastructure that let&#8217;s anyone issue &#8220;badges&#8221; (that&#8217;s what we call these signs of recognition) and that let&#8217;s users move them freely around the web</strong>. For </span><span style="color: #000000;">det</span>ails check the background materials on the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/badges" target="_blank">Mozilla wiki</a> and follow <a href="http://eknight.com" target="_blank">Erin&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I did twist the title of Jeff Young&#8217;s latest piece for reasons of pure sensationalism (and recursive puns). I also wouldn&#8217;t mind a more diverse readership and ranking higher in a google search for &#8220;naked&#8221; should help with that.  Anyways, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Teach-Naked-Effort-Strips/47398/" target="_blank">Jeff&#8217;s article for College 2.0</a> suggests that less technology in the class-room might lead to better teaching (teaching naked = without technology). At least that&#8217;s the experience of Jose Bowen, a Professor at the <a href="http://smu.edu/meadows/" target="_blank">Meadows School of the Arts</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with most of his points (powerpoint lectures stink, presentation/podcastast/videos should be made available for students out-of-class, there is a lot of bad teaching, etc.), but have not experienced the same resistance by students to leave behind the &#8220;broadcast&#8221; model of lecturing. My impression is that the cause for student resistance is unrelated to technology or teaching styles. Too often, students don&#8217;t know why they are studying a particular topic, and how it relates to their degree and their lifes. In such a situation, where students don&#8217;t see the relevance and meaning of what they are supposed to learn, they rely on lecturers to break down the content in a way that &#8212; at least &#8212; let&#8217;s them succeed on the test. However, once the purpose is clear, students readily embrace opportunities to engage more actively. The resistance I have experienced comes mainly from lecturers, who are comfortable with a teaching style that is designed not to challenge their &#8220;expert&#8221; positions vis-a-vis the students. Admitting that there is something they don&#8217;t know is scary for many lecturers, but it&#8217;s the norm online &#8211; where every google search and visit to wikipedia is an acknowledgment that there is something we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>An important point that Jeff makes about half-way down the article (a little too late in my opinion) deals with Jose Bowen&#8217;s fundamental support for technology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bowen is part of a group of college leaders who haven&#8217;t given up on that dream of shaking up college instruction. Even though he is taking computers out of classrooms, he&#8217;s not anti-technology. He just thinks they should be used differently—upending the traditional lecture model in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>We know that when technology is used to alleviate bad teaching practices, it will often just compound the problems. The easy, and wrong, response is to blame the technology. Rather than point out examples where bad teaching was made worse, we should look at how the best use of technology is innovating learning. The problem is that these examples might be easy to overlook, because they take place outside of institutions, or because <em>learning</em> becomes a part of solving a problem or taking action, rather than exist as an activity <em>per se</em>. A friend recently pointed out the practices of knowledge sharing in the online poker communities, which seem perfectly in line with the ideals of academia. And it comes as no surprise that many smaller institutions, often colleges and technical universities or Art schools in the case of Professor Bowen, are able to move faster and innovate more rapidly than their larger more traditional (and sometimes more reputable) counterparts. Yet, unless we start looking at what&#8217;s happening outside of education institutions, we might miss a technology-enabled revolution in learning that takes place right in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>Apparently something similar is happening in cycling:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One factoid from the <a target="_blank" href="http://cosl.usu.edu/events/opened2008/">Open Ed conference in Utah</a> that has been banging around the inside of my head is this: Apparently students that access video lectures online like to speed them up. At the University of Taiwan, students watch calculus lectures between 1.6 and 2 times faster than they were recorded. Willem from the <a target="_blank" href="http://ocw.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a> reported that one of their students&#8217; most used features was the ability to play the videos at double speed. And someone from MIT said the same was true for users of <a target="_blank" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>. </p>
<p>For some of these speed freaks, the videos are clearly repetition of materials that they have already learned, and they are just skimming through them in preparation for an exam. But many of the users in Taiwan did not even show up for the exam (the courses were not mandatory). Also, in Taiwan it turned out that all of the users who liked to go faster, lived in the same dorm &#8211; nobody who lived outside of the dorm had come up with the idea. </p>
<p>I would be interested to find out how self-learners that have no interest in assessment work with these videos &#8211; do they also find them too slow? <b>And how do students feel about their professors (too slow)?</b> Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hellkom.co.za/">Telkom</a>&#8216;s bandwidth policies, I rarely download lecture videos, but I do listen to quite a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Podcast.aspx">podcasts</a>. And different from these OCW users, I usually find myself pausing and skipping back to listen to certain passages a second time, rather than wanting to go faster. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A response to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roughtype.com">Nicholas Carr</a>&#8216;s recent piece in The Atlantic points out that the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; goes much beyond access to technology issues. A UCLA researcher studying memory and aging, notes that the use of certain technologies can rewire the way we think &#8211; with wide ranging implications on what social practices we develop. In a recent study on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.researchictafrica.net">ICT access and use in Africa</a> that I participated in &#8211; we found that those with access to ICT were more similar with each other &#8211; regardless of the country they lived in &#8211; than with the majority of their countrymen. Will the social practices that these digital natives develop become more and more out of sync with their non-connected peers? </p>
<p>On the upside, this could also mean that using tools which develop collaborative practices and encourage the open sharing of ideas (such as wikis) will remap our brains in ways that will lead to more socially beneficial behaviour. So that the experience of sharing ideas might allow us to get better at sharing land, water, and oil? Let&#8217;s face it, those are important skills to learn!</p>
<p>Following is the complete <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200810/letters">letter to The Atlantic</a>, that was sent in response to this article &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google">Is Google making us stupid?</a>&#8221; by Nicholas Carr (I underlined parts of it).</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="drop"></span>Nicholas Carr correctly notes that technology is changing our lives and our brains. The average young person spends more than eight hours each day using technology (computers, PDAs, TV, videos), and much less time engaging in direct social contact. Our UCLA brain-scanning studies are showing that such repeated exposure to technology alters brain circuitry, and young developing brains (which usually have the greatest exposure) are the most vulnerable. <u>Instead of the traditional generation gap, we are witnessing the beginning of a <i>brain gap</i> that separates <i>digital natives</i>, born into 24/7 technology, and <i>digital immigrants</i>, who came to computers and other digital technology as adults.   </u>
<p>This perpetual exposure to technology is leading to the next major milestone in brain evolution. <u>More than 300,000 years ago, our Neanderthal ancestors discovered handheld tools, which led to the co-evolution of language, goal-directed behavior, social networking, and accelerated development of the frontal lobe, which controls these functions. Today, video-game brain, Internet addiction, and other technology side effects appear to be suppressing frontal-lobe executive skills and our ability to communicate face-to-face. Instead, our brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture. </u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/CandaceThille/58820">Candace Thille</a> from Carnegie Mellon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmu.edu/oli/">Open Learning Initiative</a>, spoke about a<br />
research network that CM and the Open University UK are starting in<br />
order to find better ways to analyse effectiveness of open educational<br />
resources. Besides the much needed focus on rigorous analysis of the<br />
benefits of open education on the individual learner (something that<br />
only very few institutions other than CM have done) she made two<br />
comments about the objectives for the OER movement that stuck in my<br />
mind:</p>
<p>She argued that part of the reason we are lacking more generally<br />
accepted ways to describe effectiveness of open educational resources<br />
is that <b>the OER movement was founded on a belief &#8212; sharing knowledge is a good thing &#8212; and not much more</b>.<br />
There was no clearly defined goal, not even a clearly defined problem<br />
that this movement was created to address. What the community is<br />
lacking is a shared goal, why we are developing all this stuff. If we<br />
had a shared goal and then some smaller goals to support the overall<br />
one, we would have a better idea what we are doing this for.</p>
<p>She went on to suggest one (actually two) such goals: Increasing the<br />
amount of knowledge in the world, and more equitably distributing it.<br />
As a result there would be more that we know about the world and how to<br />
make it a good place, and more people know it and have access to the<br />
power that comes from knowing it. I am paraphrasing her &#8211; she was more<br />
eloquent than my typing was able to keep up with.</p>
<p>While I like the way she describes the goals, I do not agree that they<br />
have been absent. Maybe they haven&#8217;t been as clearly expressed as the<br />
goals of the free software movement were laid out by Richard Stallman<br />
early on &#8212; but many of the projects that are part of the OER movement<br />
do in fact <i>increase the amount of knowledge in the world and more equitably distribute it</i>.<br />
The OER movement has many facettes, and different people and<br />
organisations participate for very different reasons. There are first<br />
efforts to identify a shared narrative &#8212; for example through the <a target="_blank" href="http://capetowndeclaration.org">Cape<br />
Town Open Education Declaration</a> &#8212; and these will provide a map of the<br />
landscape that projects can relate to, but we have seen that the belief<br />
in a powerful idea &#8212; that sharing knowledge is a good thing &#8212; can<br />
provide enough common ground (or is it shared ground) for many<br />
incredible things to happen. 10 years ago, who would have thought that<br />
there would be over 6000 courses published openly online, that there<br />
would be an online encyclopedia that reaches beyond the size and<br />
quality of traditional encyclopedias, and that we would be using<br />
software developed by open communities of volunteer contributors to<br />
make it all happen? All of these things increase the amount of<br />
knowledge in the world and help to more equitably distribute it. Maybe<br />
it took a empiricist like Candice to take a hard look at the movement,<br />
and verbalise what the community had been doing all along, without<br />
being fully aware of it. </p>

I like the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that Jon promotes. Where I don&#8217;t agree with him is that entrepreneurial is the same as market-driven. Reading through his post, I remembered Derek Bok&#8217;s excellent &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Universities-Marketplace-Commercialization-Higher-Education/dp/0691120129/ref=sr_1_1/203-5208046-3668720?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&amp;qid=1214412930&amp;sr=1-1">Universities in the Marketplace</a>&#8220;, which analyses in some detail the detrimental effect that a market focused approach can have on education, providing examples from mostly U.S. universities.</p>
<p>Jon makes a sound argument that top teachers need better compensation and incentives, but in South Africa it is not just the top teachers, but all teachers. Only focusing on the top 1%, and by proxy the top few% of graduates that are taught by these teachers, is not enough. My sense is that many developing countries have a small group (maybe 1%?) of highly-educated and skilled people, but what is needed is a broader middle-class of professionals; and the teachers to educate them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to see different voices bringing different perspective to the argument for breaking down boundaries, and increasing innovation!</p>
