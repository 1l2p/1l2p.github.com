		<description><![CDATA[At my university lectures are recorded. I like watching them at 1.5 or 2x speed because you can go through material faster (when cramming) or for reviewing familiar material (like a lazy-man&#039;s version of skim-reading notes).

I find it also keeps you awake because its harder to keep up with someone talking about transmembrane proteins at twice the speed, and my theory is that it speeds up your brain, because when you go back to normal speed it feels like the lecturer is speaking in slow motion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My problem with high-speed audio is that there is very little structure to hold on to and especially if speakers make long(ish) arguments, it&#039;s easy to get lost if you don&#039;t listen to the whole train of thought in one go. What would be great is an outline of the audio with short abstracts of the different sections, like a table of content, that let&#039;s you skip to the part you are interested in, or back to the part you missed.

I hope any open source software developers are reading this (very slowly, not just skimming!) and feel inspired to work on something like this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This makes perfect sense to me. Voice is a very low-bandwidth medium, and I often find listening to long presentations quite tedious. _Especially_ if I probably know part of the material already (like listening to conference proceedings on topics I am familiar with). Here, scanning a text and then slowing down when I hit something interesting would be far more efficient. I haven&#039;t actually tried speeding up a video, but I could see it working quite well - especially if you had a nice interface, and were able to easily slow it down to normal speed, or even slower, to capture details (I often pause it to read off slides for example).

Sadly, this is almost impossible with all the streaming video out there.]]></description>
