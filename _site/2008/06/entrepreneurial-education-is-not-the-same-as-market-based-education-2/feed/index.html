		<description><![CDATA[Great perspective.  I&#039;d add two things to it:

#1 - I agree that market-based education systems and entrepreneurial education are not the same thing.  However, I&#039;d offer that a market-based education system is a *prerequisite* for entrepreneurial education to take place.  After all, it&#039;s impossible to identify any area of society where people operate entrepreneurially where a market doesn&#039;t exist.

#2 - Second, I think the opportunity for greater compensation at all levels tends to start at the top.  Think about golf.  How much did the average PGA tour professional make prior to Tiger Woods?  A lot less than they do today.  Tiger entered the game and revolutionized it and everyone has benefited from that.

I feel the same can be true in education.  Give people at the top huge incentives (and not just financial) and you&#039;ll find people at all levels raising their game and therefore increasing the amount of value they are providing.]]></description>
