		<description><![CDATA[Hey Gareth:

Great to hear from you (and thanks for the link to your blog). I might consider postponing that trip to Mexico, if you guys moved back to South Africa permanently. You must have enjoyed the recent cricket matches.

I&#039;ll have to think of another &quot;secret&quot; - it was hard enough coming up with 7. Why don&#039;t you try it as well, consider yourself properly tagged hereby.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I like to argue.&quot;

Great post Philipp, but i&#039;m sorry, you need to add another one. Even with a few brief encounters with you, I already know that you like to argue (even if it&#039;s just over the quality of wine).

Hope all is well bo the kaap. As much as Monterrey may be beautiful in the spring, remember that we are coming to visit mid-April too!

tschuss.
