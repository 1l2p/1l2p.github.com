		<description><![CDATA[Ahoy Reverend - Harrrrr!

Excellent course, perfect for P2PU. The freshmen at UMW are clearly having too much fun. I am working on a paper on open accreditation this week, but hope to start setting the P2PU sails next week so we can play around with pulling content in. What are you thinking in terms of storing the course outline? I noticed that BYU is using WP for their Open Courseware - they simply create blog pages for the content. That would work. However, my gut feeling is that keeping the basic course outline on a wiki seems more remixable.

Sail Ho!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Philipp,

I really think  an RSS architecture wherein P2P becomes a kind of syndication bus for resources that can be archived and expanded would be awesome.  I have an idea for teaching a course on Pirates and Zombies (then and now) through P2P wherein we can test this structure.  The course is something I have been developing for a freshman seminar at UMW, but I would really like to throw it out at P2P and see if it might provide an interesting case study/model.  let me know if you are interested.]]></description>
