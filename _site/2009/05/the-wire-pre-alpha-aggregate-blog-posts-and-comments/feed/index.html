		<description><![CDATA[@butwait:

I am @sharingnicely on twitter. Thanks for the friendly feedback. I much agree on the need for quick and snappy tutorials to make it easier for others to adopt these tools. It&#039;s actually not very complicated anymore to do so, but to get mainstream education on board some of the complexity still needs to be taken out - and the edges rounded nicely. I am a pull person, but don&#039;t really know much about push, except that it hasn&#039;t worked for me in personal communication. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is exciting stuff... nice work, Philip &amp; crew!

Down the line, we need to figure out how to get more people on board with a &quot;roll your own&quot; mentality, and/or pull together some dead-simple tutorial action... I feel the desire to evangelize!

If I built an iPhone app that could search for the college/university feeds that were all about campus visit opportunities, at this point I&#039;d get the little spinning search wheel of death... nobody&#039;s rolling those feeds. At least I don&#039;t think they are.

Which force is stronger, do you think, the pull or the push? Folks working to figure out better homegrown aggregation &amp; eduglu are at this point often trying to aggregate content that is waaaaay off the radar of the folks in mobile development who are furiously trying to figure out how to push the latest line-dancing mortgage rate ad in front of our eyeballs. I&#039;m interested in that gap.

(And are you on Twitter, Philip? Couldn&#039;t tell from your blog. I&#039;m @butwait, and just starting to groove on the possibilities of smarter aggregation.)]]></description>
