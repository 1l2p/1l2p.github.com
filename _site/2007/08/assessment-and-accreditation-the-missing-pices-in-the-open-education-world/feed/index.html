		<description><![CDATA[Hi Werutz: I am by no means an expert on SQL or database programming, so I wouldn&#039;t be able to point you to the best open educational resources on the topic.

The mysql project has a number of mailing lists (http://lists.mysql.com/) that could probably help with your question. Also, just participating in the mailing list and raising questions, and helping answer other peoples&#039; questions, is a tremendous learning experience. In a large study conducted by UNU-MERIT (http://www.merit.unu.edu), many developers mentioned that learning and sharing knowledge were key motivating factors for their participation.
