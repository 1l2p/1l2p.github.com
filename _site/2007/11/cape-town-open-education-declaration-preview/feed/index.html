		<description><![CDATA[Philipp,

It&#039;s just a draft. Then again it always will be, so long as we share it nicely. Perhaps here.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Education_Declaration
Well, we might be able to if it didn&#039;t get deleted. Give me time.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view#Policy_enforcement_is_in_it.27s_interpretation

Do us a favour will ya? Could you contact Lorcan http://orweblog.oclc.org/
and ask him to contribute. We really need a librarian with a global perspective.

Would yu also ask him to take a look at this page.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes
and ask him if he could get these guys
http://ddc.typepad.com/
to something constructive (for a change:)

I&#039;ll also note &#039;Real Time Communications&#039; as it needs some mention in the draft. Sooner or later we&#039;re going to have to give these guys something to do. http://www.accessgrid.org/community
on a regular basis.

Lastly, could you put some forums? I&#039;ll point you at this site as an illustration. http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/

Before yu do could we get a spec (for an online environment, including forums) and run a competition over there. It&#039;s getting boring to hear that &quot;27 people spent brainstorming, strategising, discussing, agreeing and disagreeing - and then many more weeks of the same by email&quot;, and not being able to see how they&#039;re sharing nicely.

Please, no emails or elists. If you&#039;d like to talk let&#039;s keep it above the radar. I&#039;ve set up a sandpit at Wikipedia for OED, where yo might like play occasionally

Merry christmas, and (hopefully) a happy 2008.]]></description>
