		<description><![CDATA[Hey John: Thanks for the thoughts. Would love to do something fun and special for the open web project ... is there an easy way to combine talking heads, screencasts of URL&#039;s/projects we might mention (drumbeat site, etc.), and slides/graphics if appropriate? I have been using iMovie, which comes with a new Mac but is not open source, and found it quite easy to get used to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting video Philipp. Although it takes more bandwidth and time, the novelty of video made me stick around for the whole thing. I think a mix between text/audio/video is a great way to keep your audience captivated.

Re: P2PU Open Web, perhaps we should collaborate on that next video, ping me if you want to do anything special.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly my thinking. I also prefer blogs and podcasts, and even slideshare, to video. Not only does video require more bandwidth, it also takes longer to produce - a little hack job like this one still takes a few hours to create and something like a TED presentation would take forever to script, record, edit, etc.. The other problem is -&gt; In video, not only do you want to /sound/ intelligent, but now you also have to /look/ like you are. And I realize I am wearing the same shirt as in the P2PU video. Oh my ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Philipp, you need to shave :)
I&#039;m also curious about the Shuttleworth foundation&#039;s reason for requiring this. I love video, but for straight talking, I usually prefer blogs (I can consume them much faster). The exceptions are awesome presentations with energy like the one you did about P2PU, or TED talks etc. (I also love podcasts, because I can take them with me - I usually end up listening to radio programs though, just timeshifting them).]]></description>
