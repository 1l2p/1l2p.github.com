		<description><![CDATA[Hey Bonni: I find Holocracy an aweful term (and it is trademarked on top) and it sounds more like jargon than anything particularly new.

&quot;The power of organizations today is unmatched, and their capacity for driving further evolution has never been greater. Holacracy offers a way forward – it’s up to us to make it happen.&quot; Really?!?

The article is basically a sales pitch/marketing for consulting services. If you feel there are particular ideas in the &quot;holorazy&quot; haze, which are relevant to the conversation, please mention them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, and I look forward to the course! Just as we have benefited from the experiences and examples set by other pioneer organizations, it&#039;s great that we are also trying to share our own experience, including the difficult parts. The good, the bad and the ugly! :) 

It&#039;s no doubt that trying to run a big virtual organization, where almost everyone is a volunteer, is very difficult. Some of the things you didn&#039;t mention above is how to motivate volunteers to join, and to keep working on the project. How to reward or motivate volunteers in a fair and sustainable way. How to pay somebody for their work, and not others, without creating resentment. 

How to enable self-organizing and initiative-taking by members, so that a project can scale in size - not everything needs to be coordinated or initiated by the &quot;top&quot;. How to keep decision processes open and participatory, without having to vote on every single detail, or overwhelming participants with discussions and decisions...

Many more questions. The course will be a great place to discuss these (it would be great if one of the outcomes was a wiki or a document that could be useful to others), and of course P2PU presents an ongoing lab for experimenting with these ideas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting about this. I&#039;m wondering if you have had an opportunity to look into holocracy. There seem to be some similarities and it may provide some good tools as you explore this topic.
