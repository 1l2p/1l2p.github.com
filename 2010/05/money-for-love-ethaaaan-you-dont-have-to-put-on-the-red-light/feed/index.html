		<description><![CDATA[Hi Philipp,
You may want to take a look at Andy Oram&#039;s post on O&#039;Reilly Radar last week (&lt;a HREF=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/05/crowdsourcing-and-the-challeng.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Crowdsourcing and the challenge of payment&lt;/a&gt;).  Very relevant discussion.

Perhaps an alternative to the Wikipedia example is the Mozilla model, where some contributors are paid employees and others are unpaid volunteers. It may be worth checking in with some Mozilla folks about their experiences with that model.

Dan Ariely has an interesting discussion in Predictably Irrational on what happens when a transaction moves between the social sphere (gift economy) and the commercial sphere (market economy). I think it suggests the importance of drawing a clear line between what is paid and what is unpaid. Seems like idea #2 makes a nice distinction, but #1 and #3 leave everything on the paid side of the line.

Some food for thought.
